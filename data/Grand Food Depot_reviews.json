    "text": "I recently had the pleasure of eating at Healthy Organic Catering and indulged in their Grilled Chicken Pesto Sandwich and Turkey Club. The experience was nothing short of delightful.\n\nThe Grilled Chicken Pesto Sandwich was a burst of flavors with its fresh basil pesto, ripe tomatoes, and juice tender chicken, all nestled between perfectly toasted bread. Each bite was a harmonious blend of savory and herbaceous notes, leaving me craving more.\n\nThe Turkey Club was a classic favorite done right. The tender slices of turkey paired beautifully with crispy bacon, fresh lettuce, and juicy tomatoes, all held together by soft, toasted bread. The combination of textures and flavors made this sandwich a true standout.\n\nOverall, my experience at Healthy Organic Catering was exceptional. The use of fresh, organic ingredients shone through in every bite, and the attention to detail in the preparation of each dish was evident. I highly recommend trying the Pesto Sandwich and Turkey Club for a satisfying and delicious meal.

Waiting about 8 minutes in the lot before I got a text that my food was ready. Pull up through the alley to the vendor and grabbed my food. Cheese steak was middle of the road (my car still smells like it two days later). I’d like to see this concept rolled out in more places.
