      "raw_text": "My first time here at JNJs and let me tell you. PHENOMENAL! Sure the wait time was 40 min but they were getting people in and out. Sophie was the hostess and she was doing her job to the max. And right by her side was this cool guy with a vibe unlike no other. Always tracing the place with his eyes like a hawk making sure everything was running smoothly. Come to find out, this man was the Mark the owner. Loved his vibe dude. I loved the way he interacted with every customer that walked into his establishment. The place was bussin with people so I was like damn this man loves what he does.  Cause Interacting with every customer has to be a bit of a challenge. Although Mark made it look easy. My favorite part about this place though, besides the buttermilk pancakes and the jnj potatoes, was the fact that when I looked up and around at all the employees working they butt's off . They all had smiles on their faces . That really made my freaking day man. Which brings me to the last person I want to give props to. My waiter Zoen. Laid back but attentive. Brings you water without you asking cause he knows you're gonna need something to wash it down with. Lol. Honestly, such a great place. When I talked to Mark on my way out , I gave him props and he answered with \" We have fun here\" 😊 If the food doesn't win you over the customer service will definitely do that! Keep it up Jack's N Joe's! Keep that ish up 👏👏\n\nFood: 5\nService: 5\nAtmosphere: 5",
      "plain_text": "My first time here at JNJs and let me tell you. PHENOMENAL! Sure the wait time was 40 min but they were getting people in and out. Sophie was the hostess and she was doing her job to the max. And right by her side was this cool guy with a vibe unlike no other. Always tracing the place with his eyes like a hawk making sure everything was running smoothly. Come to find out, this man was the Mark the owner. Loved his vibe dude. I loved the way he interacted with every customer that walked into his establishment. The place was bussin with people so I was like damn this man loves what he does.  Cause Interacting with every customer has to be a bit of a challenge. Although Mark made it look easy.

      "raw_text": "On Tuesday April 30th, 2024, a precious friend and I found Jacks N Joe. Conveniently located near downtown, it was a fabulous idea to start the day. As an Oklahoman who’s accustomed to many diner-style eateries and breakfast establishments, I was comforted with how much this place felt like home.\n\nWe arrived around 10:30am (a high-demand hour). Unfortunately, the parking was a headache. It’s a one-way shared parking lot with no outlet in the front and no signs letting patrons know that there's additional (but limited) parking in the rear. For a building that occupies more than 9,000sqft and seats 60-100 people, the parking situation is not the best. Giving he crowded parking, we arrived to a wait time of about 15mins.\n\nWe received a text shortly afterwards. We came back and were reunited with the host. I usually prefer for breakfast/brunch restaurants to have a minimalist layout but I can’t deny that I liked the updated, modern design – high ceiling, attached lighting, open floor, wooden fixtures, and diverse seating options. We were led to our seats, a table with a long booth against the brick wall to the right near the entrance. The server was nice and polite but visibly busy. Still, her service to us was not deterred. We were handed two grand menus, one side flapjacks, other side everything else. While I browsed the menu and chatted away, I decided to get the Pineapple Mango smoothie while my friend got the Strawberry Banana. After having both, we both preferred the Pineapple Mango. Then we ordered. She ordered the JNJ Potatoes, Avocado Toast with Eggs while I ordered 2 slices of ham, scrambled eggs and the Jack’s Banana Flapjacks. To my surprise, the food came out rather quickly (roughly 10mins). Though her food looked more appealing than mine, both meals were pretty solid. Nothing bad to say about the ham or eggs, they were what you should expect from any breakfast eatery. The JNJ potatoes definitely stood out. A little salt, pepper & ketchup and you’ve got a hit. Also, the Banana Flapjacks were on point! I was instantly impressed, reminding me why their pancakes are the main attraction.\n\nGiven the number of individual items offered, the Combo options weren’t as inclusive as you’d like but I was rather satisfied with the value (especially being in Los Angeles). Overall, I think that this is a good breakfast option (amongst many) for small to medium parties. Once you finally can park, there’s plenty of seating and the number of breakfast options should be sufficient for most guests.\n\nFood: 4\nService: 5\nAtmosphere: 4",
