      "raw_text": "On approach, there was a small line of people waiting to order. I was looking forward to the Dan Dan Noodles, so I join the queue while checking the menu. A helpful staff took my order and showed me to my table.\n\nThe noodles definitely lived upto expectations. The softly cooked noodles were complemented by peanut sauce, thin strips of refreshing cucumber, coriander and sesame seeds - so smooth and creamy. The Forbidden Rice Pudding was a satisfying combination of black sticky rice, chewy taro and sweet potato balls and coconut milk.\n\nService was a little patchy overall except when the original server who took my order passed by - he was attentive and on point. The place was bustling from the weekend lunch crowd, clearly a popular choice for many.

During my visit, I tried several items including the mapo tofu, boiled dumplings, mixed noodles, and fried chicken. Every dish was delicious, full of flavor, and very satisfying.\n\nThere were also several types of rice to choose from, which made the meal feel customizable to personal taste. Although I wasn’t able to try dessert this time, the options looked very tempting, and I would love to save room for one on my next visit. The pricing felt quite reasonable given the quality and variety, making it a place I could easily see myself coming back to whenever I’m craving good Chinese food.",

My favorites from the buffet style group meal was definitely the popcorn chicken. They offered Mabo Tofu, dumplings, bok choy, etc. Good, but nothing special.  Again, I'll come back and try the menu items.\n\nI loved the 2 pre-made cocktails that they mass produced to serve the wedding rehearsal guests that were in their 2 big plastic dispensers. I was skeptical at first, but they were tasty and refreshing.\n\nI loved the open air atmosphere and high ceilings. It's definitely a trendy Taiwanese eatery and water hole.",

The kitchen, front of house and server were all very sharp and clear communicators and knew precisely what was in the food or how to take care of their guests.

I was a little sad that the pork buns were sold out, but it was a Saturday night at 8:30pm - it must have been really good.

The female Asian server today was somewhat in a hurry, and as we were already getting ready to leave (we were putting the left-over boxes in the bag), she rushed into cleaning our table and dropped silverwares on us, without proper apologies. My friend was so shocked. We left after 30 seconds she picked up all the plates from our table, I looked around and there were so many empty tables. I don’t know how much difference it could have made as she could have cleaned after 30 seconds, and I don’t know why she was so eager to clean it and couldn’t wait for that 30 seconds. Maybe this could be improved as the restaurant already offers lots of self-service.",

It’s a fairly casual establishment where you order at the front, take a table number, and then find an open table to sit at.

The food comes out lightning quick, with dishes being brought out as they are ready rather than all coming out together. All the food was excellent, with a great combination of flavors and textures in each dish. The popcorn chicken and crispy rice cakes & mushrooms were delightfully crispy, and the braised beef in the beef noodle soup was melt in your mouth tender. The beef roll and pan fried pork buns were some of my favorites, and the dan dan noodles were also excellent. I highly recommend going with a group so that you can try a variety of different dishes - it’s so hard to pick just one!

I bet if these were eaten fresh, they would have been even better.\n\nNext, we had their Bok Choy Dumplings which were four large, pan-fried pieces of goodness that came with a fire dipping sauce. They seriously have the texture of their dumplings down perfectly.\n\nFinally, the Dan Dan Noodles completed the meal - wheat noodles covered in a seasoned sesame based dressing with fresh cucumbers and peanuts. The dish is simple but it was one of the best DDN I've had in a while.\n\nI look forward to checking out the actual restaurant in the future because the delivery was amazing.
