We did get there at 9:30pm and they close at 10pm but we asked if  they could still serve a table for 5 people and said no problem. So we ordered and paid right away because we understood the time. But by 9:50pm we were getting rushed out. We did finish most of our food and ready to get out of there by 10. But the entire time we were there was really uncomfortable. If they would have told us only to go orders that would have been fine. But to dine in that was my worst experience at a dine in restaurant. I wouldn’t ever come back or recommend this place “based on today’s experience” there are so many other Thai restaurants to choose from. This one is definitely a Nooo!!!!\n\nMeal type: Dinner\nPrice per person: $20–30\nFood: 3\nService: 1\nAtmosphere: 2",

Whether you're grabbing a casual lunch or dining in with friends, the space feels inviting.\n\nThe food is consistently flavorful and generous in portion size. Some favorites from my visits:\n\nChicken Satay (4 pcs): Perfectly grilled and served with rich peanut sauce, this makes for an ideal starter.\n\nSpicy Rib-Eye Salad: A standout dish with tender steak slices that are full of flavor and paired with fresh greens and a spicy kick.\n\nMango Salmon Salad: A refreshing and well-balanced dish—grilled salmon filets with mango slices and crisp veggies make it both light and satisfying.\n\nThai Milk Tea w/ Boba is very popular among the desks while I think it might be too sweet.\n\nFor mains:\n\nPineapple Fried Rice and Phad Thai are excellent choices. Both are served in generous portions, often enough for two people. The Phad Thai features a sweet-savory balance with a crunch of peanuts and customizable protein options.\n\nGreen Curry is aromatic and creamy, while the Red and Yellow curries pack more heat—too spicy for my taste, but perfect for chili lovers. Rice would be offered with the curry.\n\nTom Yum Soup is an option too, though I found it a bit too heavy on spices, leaning toward an overpowering profile.\n\nService here is consistently warm and efficient. The staff are friendly and the food is prepared quickly, making it a great option even on a tight schedule.\n\nParking is available in the covered lot behind the apartment complex, which adds to the convenience—something rare around campus.\n\n---\n\nIn summary, Thai by Trio offers a great balance of taste, price, and speed—a dependable choice near USC for satisfying Thai cuisine.\n\nService: Dine in\nMeal type: Dinner\nPrice per person: $20–30\nFood: 5\nService: 5\nAtmosphere: 5\nRecommended dishes: Bulgogi, Crab Fried Rice, Chicken Satay, Thai Boat Noodle Soup, Chicken Pad Thai, Pineapple Fried Rice, Tom Yum Soup\nWait time: Up to 10 min\nRecommendation for vegetarians: Somewhat recommend\nVegetarian offerings: Vegetarian menu or section\nParking space: Somewhat difficult to find parking\nParking options: Free parking garage",

Also I feel all the food is premade. We literally finished ordering and the food took 5 min to be served. Not the greatest feeling as you paying fresh to order not fast food. So very questionable. I had the Pad Thai $18 noodles and they were to wet and soggy also hardly any noodles served. Chicken curry $18 I’m not kidding when I say you can count the 6 slices of thin small pieces of chicken. Tom Kah Soup $24 for the pot which also was small. I will say it was good I enjoyed it also they do have a nice ambiance and the place is clean. I spent about $85 total 2 people. Thai is one of my favorite foods and I look forward to ordering different dishes and sharing amongst my family and always having leftovers to take home. However not the case here and well not that great either. I would not come back.
