I recently got the fish taco and shrimp taco to keep things simple and it didn’t break the bank! You can still spend under $15 here and enjoy with the flavor they provide! It’s one of the freshest flavors you will try and the four salsas they have are quite selective with the choices from smoked chiles and habanero chiles. The seafood level of freshness is freshly caught and always sure to be served to the best quality levels possible. One thing that I love is the thickness of the tortillas. They are freshly made and keep their texture together with each bite you take. I would put Holbox above any typical seafood restaurant. It is going to blow your mind and if you are open to eating raw or cooked in lime shellfish, you are in for a treat beyond your imagination.

The scallops taco was cooked to perfection like I’ve never tasted scallops this well cooked before! Finally, it was my first time to try sea urchins, and they were absolutely delicious! I loved how it was presented and the I really enjoyed the ceviche that came with it. It was so fresh and creamy it melted in my mouth. Great staff and food service.

It was only about 28 miles, but I spent almost two hours to arrive at Holbox. I don't know why the traffic was so horrible that day, or maybe it was just as normal as every day.\n\nFor friends who know me, I don't go to fine dining frequently. I had too much fine dining back in Shanghai. I'd rather find interesting dining spots--inside food courts, at food trucks, etc. Holbox is a Michelin one-star restaurant, but not pricey. Even though it's in a food court and not a traditional restaurant, it's interesting. The food booth doesn't have its own tables in the food court; they're shared with others.\n\nIt's a Mexican food booth. The boss lady--puebla in Spanish--was tough, but not rude. As with most Michelin spots, there was a queue, but it wasn't too long. I grabbed a table stand and found us a place to sit.\n\nNot long after, the food was served. The free tortilla chips had no shining points--just as normal as in every Mexican restaurant. Crispy, flat dipping, better than nothing. Good for snacking after a long drive.\n\nThe food was served one by one, or you could say delivered one by one:\n\nErizo 5/5\nThe word erizo in Spanish means hedgehog, but it can also mean sea urchin. They actually look quite similar. Basically, it's sea urchin. Not everyone likes it--some love it, some hate it. I'm a big fan, uni in Japanese. There were two sea urchins, each with about four or five roes. Underneath were fish and scallop ceviches, but different from normal ceviche--it was lighter, without vinegar or lemon taste, more pure raw seafood. I liked it. Not cheap at $27 for an appetizer.\n\nTaco de Pulpo en su Tinta (Octopus Taco) 5/5\nBasically, it's an octopus taco, mixed with squid ink or cuttlefish in--I couldn't tell. The ink mostly gave it color, with just a faint hint of the sea for flavor. Each taco had a giant octopus tentacle--three tacos on a plate, one tentacle for each. The texture was excellen--soft, tender, not juicy but still moist, not fishy at all. I bet the octopus was stewed for a long time, which made it so tasty. Very good. $7 for three, which I wouldn't call expensive--actually well priced.\n\nPescado a las Brasas 5/5\nFish, who doesn't like fish? A few-bone fish, no tiny bones. The seabass had only one big bone but no tiny bones between the muscles. It was grilled seabass, not heavily marinated but well seasoned. The freshness was its biggest strength.\n\nCilantro Rice and Black Beans 5/5\nThe rice was served with the grilled seabass, dipped in stewed black beans. I had never tried that before, but it was tasty. Not too much cilantro aroma, but still good. The rice itself was perfectly cooked--grains separated, not sticky. Paired with the black beans, it was a great match.\n\nI recommend this food booth in the food court, not only because of its Michelin crown, but also for the way they used squid/cuttlefish ink, how they treated cilantro, lemon, and avocado. They truly put heart into making good food.\n\nMeal type: Dinner\nPrice per person: $30–50\nFood: 5\nService: 2\nAtmosphere: 5\nNoise level: Moderate noise\nSeating type: Indoor dining area, Booth seating, Counter seating",

Here is my review by item:\n\nHalibut tostada - 10/10 - Spectacular, by far the best halibut ceviche I have had to date. The fish is premium quality and melt-in your mouth and the exact right amount of citrus to spice.\n\nAtun Tostada (Tuna Ceviche) - 7/10 - Good. The fish is very fresh but the flavor profile of the ceviche mix can use some work. Also, I am a seafood lover and the white-ish sauce paired with the tuna looked unappealing at first presentation, even to me.\n\nTaco de Pulpo en su Tinta (Braised Octopus taco)  - 0/10 - Disgusting!!!! So gross the lingering flavor was making me nauseous on the ride home. (Note: Ive eaten octopus many times - I tried this based on many good experiences). You get a big tortilla with just a piece of crisped (bland) octopus that tasted old and had an extremely gamey flavor. I hated this. Regret ordering it.\n\nScallop Taco - 1/10 - A throwaway dish undeserving of the good money paid for it. Turns out Scallops don’t belong in tacos. Being such a novelty I just had to try it. Huge mistake. Again, the tortilla to filling ratio was way off. All I could taste was bread. The scallops were extremely bland, had a boiled texture - no sear, no char. With only 2 scallops in a thick tortilla, it was like they weren’t even there. Such a waste of perfectly good scallops. Hated this.\n\nAll 3 stars are for the ceviches (tostadas). The cooked seafood is so awful I am insulted I was charged money for them as I feel I should be paid for the trouble of eating them.\n\nFood: 3\nService: 5\nAtmosphere: 4",

The cooked seafood is so awful I am insulted I was charged money for them as I feel I should be paid for the trouble of eating them.",

The standouts were the tostada, uni, smoked Kanpachi taco, and the grilled lobster. The Uni was fresh and buttery, served in its shell with scallop and an aioli-like sauce of somekind, mouthwatering. Lobster was grilled evenly, pre broken, served with melted butter, avocado tomatoes, and what can go wrong with a live lobster? Nothing, and they weighed the lobster in front of us, let us snap photos despite being so busy which was sweet of them. The smoked kanpachi taco was great with tender fish and a crunchy blue corn shell. The only dishes we wouldn’t order again were the blood clams, and octopus taco. The taco was chewy and the clams just didn't stand out among the rest.\n\nThe food came out as it was ready, so pacing wasn’t ideal, but understandable for this kind of spot.\n\nAll in all, Holbox is absolutely worth a visit.

      "raw_text": "Came in with high hopes due to the Michelin rating and was not disappointed. My wife and I decided to do a huge sampling of whatever caught our eye on the menu.\n\nThe Spot Prawn and Scallop Aguachile was super fresh (prawns grabbed right out of the tank) and refreshing. The lime cilantro chile sauce was crisp and tasty with a hint of heat. Great summer dish.\n\nBeing a huge ceviche fan we had the Ceviche de Atun. The bluefin tuna was superb. Another well balanced crisp dish that you couldn’t stop eating.\n\nThe star of our meal though was the Tostada de Kanpachi & Uni. An absolute masterpiece. Beautifully layered textures and tastes. The uni was like icing on the cake to some amazing flavors. Even the tostada had amazing flavor. Would come back just for this dish!\n\nThe Pulpo a las Brasas was a pick of mine as I am a sucker for octopus. Super tender with a light char and smokiness. Not sure what the sauce was underneath but it was velvety smokey deliciousness. Even the side of cilantro rice and beans were top notch.\n\nTacos: We had the Baja Fish Taco and the Smoked Kanpachi Taco. Best fish taco I have ever had in my life. Fish was crisp and not greasy. Perfect amount of crema and salsa. The Kanpachi taco was delicious as well but the Baja taco was just a masterpiece of a taco staple. One thing that got my attention in both was the blue corn tortillas. This is what a tortilla is supposed to be. Never had such delicious tortillas in my life. Crazy how the smallest part of the dish can hold up everything and compete in flavor with the exotic ingredients.\n\nAlso enjoyed: we had the sparkling lemonade (tasted more like orange to me). Whatever was in it was amazing and refreshing. Not too sweet.\n\nPricing: who cares. I thought for the level of execution and the quality of ingredients the dishes would be a value at even a higher price point. Great value in my eyes.\n\nUnpretentious culinary adventure in a food hall. Keep doing what you are doing! You have an amazing team kicking out some amazing food!\n\nMeal type: Dinner\nPrice per person: $50–100\nFood: 5\nService: 5\nAtmosphere: 5\nNoise level: Moderate noise\nWait time: 10-30 min",

However the taste and textures disappeared.  The octopus was too soft and mushy, the grilled shrimp was overwhelmed by tomato sauce, and there is spiciness in nearly every dish even though it's not listed on the menu. The scallops on their own tasted good but in the taco not so much. They were sold out of the softshell crab and hamachi collar so come for lunch if you want to catch those.

The tortillas provided a variety of textures, and the sauce was beautifully presented.\n\n3. Green Shrimp Aguachile\n\nThe large shrimp and the green sauce were refreshing and tangy. The cucumber and onion complemented each other well, leaving a lasting impression. The flavor could be a bit strong.\n\n4. Raw Oyster Plate\n\nFresh oysters generously served on ice! The basics were perfect, and the three different sauces made it even more enjoyable to enjoy. The refreshing flavor was a bonus.\n\n5. Uni in Sea Urchin Shell\n\nThe visuals were absolutely stunning! However, the strong sauce underneath overshadowed the uni's unique savory flavor, which was a shame. The visual appeal was truly Instagram-worthy.\n\n6. Octopus Grill Plate\n\nThe octopus was chewy on the outside and had a smoky flavor! The grilled lemon, avocado, and tomato salad complemented the dish perfectly, making both the plating and the taste satisfying.\n\n7. Two Tacos (Fish + Octopus)\n\nThe fish taco had a crispy batter and the savory sauce complemented it well. The octopus taco was bursting with smoky flavor! Both were served on blue corn tortillas, adding a unique touch of color.\n\nPicking peas were $8.\n\nPrice per person: $20–30\nFood: 3\nService: 3\nAtmosphere: 3\nWait time: 10-30 min",

I came here solo since I was in LA for the day and one of the workers asked me if it was just me, when I told her yes she told me that I can sit at the bar vs having to continue to wait in the long line.

A team member kindly made sure we got seats at the bar without us even asking again — it felt like they were really looking out for us. The chefs were friendly, knowledgeable, and proud of their craft.

The cashier was super sweet and offered good recommendations while also explaining the meaning of Holbox when I asked so thank you to her!\n\nI ordered a little bit of everything to get the full range of taste.\n\nFirst up was the ceviche de atuna or tuna ceviche. Wow. Some of the freshest most amazing tuna you'll find, this beats out a lot of sushi restaurants too. The ceviche had great flavor and the chips/tostadas on the side were the perfect pairing. My only minor complaint here was the somewhat off-balance of ceviche mix to tuna. The mix is a bit overpowering and I started picking out more of the tuna, because there was already so much stuck onto each piece.\n\nNext up was the kanpachi tostada. My fault for not eating this right away as the tostada got a bit soggy but wow - another stellar dish. The uni was the cherry on top to add a textural change as well as that ocean freshness.\n\nThe baja fish taco has to be one of the best fish tacos, even one of the best tacos I've ever had in LA. Simply done even at Michelin standards. The fish was light and so crispy, the tortilla was soft and fresh, and the salsa was perfect.\n\nLastly and another amazing dish - the smoked kanpachi quesadilla.

      "raw_text": "Holbox – A Missed Catch in a City Full of Great Tacos\n\nI really wanted to love Holbox. It’s one of LA’s most talked-about spots—Michelin-starred, James Beard–nominated, raved about on every food blog worth its salt. But for us, it just didn’t land.\n\nFrom the start, service was disorganized. Our dessert arrived before our food, and we had to flag down three different team members just to get our order. They did refund the dessert—which we appreciated—but honestly, it wasn’t worth serving in the first place. The cheesecake was dense, dry, and flavorless. It felt like an afterthought in a place that shouldn’t be mailing anything in.\n\nThe lobster dish was a real letdown. Coming from a coastal town where lobster is a way of life, I was excited—but what arrived was chewy and overcooked. The rice and beans alongside it were actually great, but not what you come here for.\n\nMichael ordered an assortment of tacos. The scallop taco was undercooked and had an off taste. The smoked kampachi taco had a cool concept, but wasn’t something either of us wanted more than a bite of. The Baja shrimp taco? That one was solid—but LA is a city of incredible tacos. If you’re going to be one of the top taco spots here, you really have to bring it. Holbox didn’t.\n\nThe ceviche was the one bright spot in terms of taste. The fish was fresh and well-marinated, but it was plated in a way that felt messy and overwhelming. The portion was huge and oddly presented—more cafeteria scoop than culinary elegance.\n\nThe fryer oil was another surprise. I have a soybean allergy—to boot—so I couldn’t even try some of the items, including the chips and fish tacos I was most excited about. They use a blended oil with soybean in their fryer, which was really unfortunate.\n\nThere’s a lot of potential here—fresh fish, inventive ideas, a casual setup that’s very LA. But execution matters, and for us, it just didn’t deliver.\n\nIn the end, the best things I had were my Diet Coke, the rice and beans, and a taco I couldn’t even eat. It’s safe to say we won’t be returning. If we ever do find ourselves back at this market, we’ll be trying the other counters instead.\n\nService: Dine in\nMeal type: Lunch\nPrice per person: $30–50\nFood: 3\nService: 1\nAtmosphere: 2",

The smoked kampachi taco had a cool concept, but wasn’t something either of us wanted more than a bite of. The Baja shrimp taco? That one was solid—but LA is a city of incredible tacos. If you’re going to be one of the top taco spots here, you really have to bring it. Holbox didn’t.\n\nThe ceviche was the one bright spot in terms of taste. The fish was fresh and well-marinated, but it was plated in a way that felt messy and overwhelming. The portion was huge and oddly presented—more cafeteria scoop than culinary elegance.\n\nThe fryer oil was another surprise. I have a soybean allergy—to boot—so I couldn’t even try some of the items, including the chips and fish tacos I was most excited about. They use a blended oil with soybean in their fryer, which was really unfortunate.\n\nThere’s a lot of potential here—fresh fish, inventive ideas, a casual setup that’s very LA. But execution matters, and for us, it just didn’t deliver.\n\nIn the end, the best things I had were my Diet Coke, the rice and beans, and a taco I couldn’t even eat. It’s safe to say we won’t be returning. If we ever do find ourselves back at this market, we’ll be trying the other counters instead.",

My fav was probably the tostada, but I have to say the uni was lost in the strong flavors of the ceviche. I'd say try any of the ceviche options to be satisfied.\n\nTheir operation is clearly well run, affordable for what the menu is, and presentation is amazing. But I was expecting more from the flavors. I didn't find any of the flavors innovative or new. Their tacos are simple and that's an item that can easily be experimented on. They have a good sized menu. I wish it was smaller and even more simple to showcase the fresh seafood or have more experimental/innovative options on the menu. Overall it was a good seafood experience. I'm not sure how I'd feel if I had to battle a weekend line. Also, not sure if I'd go out of my way to come back on my own, but for sure with newcomers.

I found an empty seat and took advantage. It's located in a food court, so expect a packed house.\n\nI was helped quickly by a gentleman. I started off with a sparkling lemonade and a taco de pulpo en su tinta. The taco was very good. The octopus was tender and went well with the calamari ink sofrito. Next I got a tostada de atun. Bluefin tuna, avocado puree and arbol peanut sauce. The combination of all 3 were great! And the homemade tostada was easy to eat. Didn't crumble at any bites, so you're enjoying every component of the plate. Lastly, I got an entrée of pulpo a la brasa. The smokiness of the octopus combined with the almond pipian was spot-on! Combine that to make a taco with the baby tomatoes and avocado slices it was a perfect combo!\n\nOverall, a great experience at $57.00. The server was attentive, although his attitude changed after my 15% tip. It's all good. Doesn't take away from the overall experience. I highly recommend coming here.\n\nService: Dine in\nMeal type: Lunch\nPrice per person: $50–100\nFood: 5\nService: 5\nAtmosphere: 4",

This honestly has to be top 5-10 best meals I've ever had in my life. Seriously. The seafood is so fresh and melts in your mouth. I had the garlic butter shrimp plate with the grilled bread, cilantro rice, and beans, and the flavor of the shrimp sauce was AMAZING. Since I was hungry, I had an array of different items, including the Tostada with the Kampachi, shrimp, and another fish, and it was out of this world!! The salsas are soooo good! The guacamole was cool (maybe needed a pinch of salt). But the showstopper were the CHURROS. Oh my god!!! Those Churros with the chocolate sauce? INSANE!!! Honestly, I'm going back again before I leave but seriously, this place is beyond words. The prices are reasonable but also range, depending on the dish and it's worth every penny. This place is deserving of its Michellin star and more. Thank you for creating this magical place. Holbox, I love you!!!\n\nFood: 5\nService: 5\nAtmosphere: 5",

I will start with the food, but I have a lot to say about the experience.\n\nYou can upload the menu on your phone or get someone in your group to grab a menu. It is good to use your wait time in the long line to the ordering counter wisely. Send others to grab drinks from another vendor. Buy a few tacos from another vendor if you are hungry.\n\nWe tried a lot of dishes. The Baja shrimp taco is traditional, but the shrimp are huge and moist, and the crema and toppings are great. Also quite good was the tostado de jurel. It is yellowtail ceviche, avocado, and an almond salsa on a very crispy corn tortilla base. It was fresh, sour, savory, and yummy. I found the scallop aguachile to be a bit too lime forward, which tends to drown out the sweetness of scallops, but if you eat it with the pieces of avocado and chips, it mellows everything out. Needless to say, all the seafood is bright and fresh.\n\nMy companions really loved the smoked kanpachi tacos, all hot and cheesy, and spicy. The camarones al mojo were sensational. This is a main dish platter, so comes with excellent black beans and cilantro rice, plus toasted bread for sopping up the marinade. The shrimp were HUGE and perfectly prepared. So all in all, the food is terrific.\n\nSo the downsides: You will pretty much have a 30 to 45 minute wait before you can order. You will need to hunt out a table in the loud, noisy, and not very clean dining hall. The food comes out in no particular order. This makes the actual dining rather chaotic. Our 6 items cost over $100. Michelin star or not, to me, how I am served and the atmosphere in which I eat makes a difference. Is the food great? Yes. Does eating it amid the chaos make it less nice? Yes, absolutely.\n\nI have eaten at a lot of Michelin started restaurants all over the world. Does this rate a Michelin star? I don't think so. But I do recommend eating here.
