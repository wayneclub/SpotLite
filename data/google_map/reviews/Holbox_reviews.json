We ordered the scallop ceviche, kampachi, lobster, and the fresh uni… and every dish was an absolute standout.\n\nThe scallop ceviche was bright and silky, bursting with clean citrus flavors. The kampachi had that perfect buttery texture, so fresh it practically melted. The lobster was rich, sweet, and cooked to perfection. But the uni wow. Creamy, briny, and unbelievably fresh… now I fully understand why Holbox earned its Michelin star.\n\nEvery plate was thoughtful, balanced, and executed with precision. This is seafood at its highest level innovative, respectful of the ingredients, and genuinely unforgettable.\n\nHolbox remains one of LA’s true culinary gems.

Tried 2 tostadas (kanpachi ceviche w uni, smoked kanpachi) and 3 tacos (smoked kanpachi, octopus, scallop), and side of cilantro rice ($2).  Tacos were superior, particularly the smoked kanpachi and the octopus!  Tostadas were good but sum not greater than parts. Food: 5 Atmosphere: 5\n\nFood: 5\nAtmosphere: 5",

But no lie, I've never had a better fish taco than the one they serve here. Holbo is killing it over at Mercado La Paloma. The line goes out, and around back of the building. But its well worth the wait. I'd like to give a shout out to to all the staff. You'd think they'd be burnt out from the intensity of the customers piling in--but they're there with their A-game, its obvious they're passionate about what they represent. I intend on experiencing their tasting menu one day. I'd highly recommend checking them out!!

Just ok, but I’ve had better elsewhere. I also tried the uni scallop — buttery, oceanic, and definitely worth a try.\n\nThe real plot twist was watching a lobster flailing after being cut in half alive. Not exactly the tableside performance I was hoping for. 🦞😳\n\nAll in all, the food’s fresh and delicious, but the hype is in the Michelin rating. There’s great seafood in L.A., and Holbox is up there — just maybe… bring emotional support if you’re squeamish.\n\nI’ll go again to check it out one more time. The line is real.

    "text": "Definitely appreciate a top rated restaurant that isn’t pricing out half the population. So 5 stars for that.\n\nService doesn’t really count—there aren’t waiters here. We waited in line, ordered, and sat and waited for our food for about an hour total on a Sunday at 530. Not crazy, considering its high ratings.\n\nThat being said, the smoked taco was incredible(!), but everything else was good, not great. I would do the taco again in a heartbeat, but would skip entering else.\n\nLoved the setting, there’s several other restaurants that looked delicious as well in the food hall.\n\nI should also say I’m not a ceviche person (but I love sushi), so maybe it’s  the wrong type of restaurant for me.

    "text": "Hidden inside Mercado La Paloma, Holbox is a Michelin-starred seafood counter that completely lives up to the hype.\nWe tried the uni & scallop tostada — freshly opened sea urchin topped with scallop and green salsa, unbelievably sweet and creamy.\nThe Filete al Carbon (grilled sea bass with cilantro rice) was perfectly cooked — crispy skin, tender meat, and full of flavor.\nBoth octopus and fried fish tacos were light, crunchy, and fresh, especially with their house-made hot sauces.\nThe Kanpachi ceviche was bright and balanced, a perfect mix of acid and spice.\n\nEverything tasted so clean and ocean-fresh.\nIt’s a casual spot, not fancy at all, but the quality easily rivals high-end restaurants.

The atmosphere is nothing to write home about as it is in a food hall and you find your own table.  But you do not come here for the atmosphere...  It is the food.  The seafood is super fresh - you really can taste the freshness.  We ordered multiple tacos - baja fish, shrimp, octopus, grilled fish, grilled branzino, ceviche...  Each dish was great.  The price - ridiculously inexpensive...  For all the food we ordered, the total bill was about $125 with tips...  A long wait, however.

A fair amount of persistence will be required to dine here.\n\nFor those in LA craving top-tier seafood, a pilgrimage to Holbox is an absolute must.

    "text": "Definitely worth doing a little drive to get to this elevated food court and trying Holbox. This is some of the city’s best fresh Mexican cuisine, with a focus on seafood.\n\nDo yourself a favor and order a bunch of stuff, it’s worth it. We got: Branzino, Scallop Aguachile, fresh Santa Barbara Uni, Kanpachi & Uni Tostada, Kanpachi Taco, and Baja Fish Taco.\n\nOverall, whatever you do, get the Scallop Aquachile and something with Sea Urchin. By far, probably the best Sea Urchin I’ve had in my life. The Smoked Kampachi Taco was quite good too, it had a peanut chili oil (Salsa Macha) which I’ve never seen before until here. Really cool.\n\nThe Branzino was fresh and cooked perfectly, with insanely good blue corn tortillas to go alongside. The Baja Fish taco was pretty standard.\n\nAll in all, I try to come here every time I come to LA now. You get FRESH FRESH FISH here and it shows. Recently, there’s been lines out the door. Worth the wait, I think, but maybe come at a weird time and you won’t have to worry.\n\nAll of this order was like $100.

The Baja shrimp tacos were also great and a good size compared to any shrimp tacos I ever had. The octopus tacos were cooked just right and were large enough to have a good chew and bite and I really liked the sauce that came with it. The scallops taco was cooked to perfection like I’ve never tasted scallops this well cooked before! Finally, it was my first time to try sea urchins, and they were absolutely delicious! I loved how it was presented and the I really enjoyed the ceviche that came with it. It was so fresh and creamy it melted in my mouth. Great staff and food service. I highly recommend as a first time Michelin star restaurant on a budget. Food: 5 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 5\n\nFood: 5\nService: 5\nAtmosphere: 5",

    "text": "Came here with a friend for lunch on Friday and this place totally deserves its Michelin star. We got there about 15 minutes before opening, so parking was easy and we were part of the first group in line.\n\nHolbox serves Yucatán-style seafood tacos, and every single one we tried was incredible. We ordered the scallop taco, octopus taco, smoked kanpachi taco, Baja fish taco, and the aguachile with spot prawn and scallops. The scallop was buttery and sweet, the octopus was super tender with that perfect char, and the smoked kanpachi had this deep, smoky flavor that was just insane. The aguachile was bright, spicy, and refreshing—perfect for a warm day.\n\nThe service was exceptional. You order at the counter, and they somehow manage to bring everything out quickly and perfectly timed, even with so many tables scattered around the market. It’s impressive how smoothly everything runs.\n\nWe finished with the churros and chocolate sauce, which were the perfect ending—crispy, light, and the chocolate was rich but not overly sweet.\n\nThe small lot is paid (about $4 an hour), but there’s some free street parking if you get lucky. Definitely worth coming a little early for a spot.\n\nCan’t wait to come back and try more of the menu, especially anything with uni. This place is a gem.

    "text": "I had huge expectation for Michelle 1 star. Long story short, it is not worth to wait 1 hour to get the food. I might try again if no line.\nThe octopus was good but not exceptional, the sauce was not aligned with octopus and not tasty.\nThe Aguachille was too sour and couldn't enjoy it well. Octopus taco was good. Smoked kanpachi taco was hmmmm. I don't smell any smoke and just plain taco.\nUrchin was good and I might come back for it. Lemonade was fresh good, but not super excellent. Dish setting is good for the price but not Michelle star up scale.\nI think there are lots of people due to relatively reasonable price for Michelle star, but taste is not balanced well, and not tasty  for the star value.

We ordered octopus, octopus tacos, shrimp tacos, and lemonade with soda.\n\nThe octopus was very well prepared, tender, and flavorful. The octopus and shrimp tacos were an excellent choice: a good portion, fresh ingredients, and well presented.\n\nThe lemonade with soda was refreshing, although a little sweet for my taste.\n\nThe service was friendly and fast, and the atmosphere is relaxed, ideal for enjoying seafood with friends or family.\n\nOverall, a recommended experience if you like seafood with a twist.

    "text": "After a serious ceremony at Malibu Beach, I decided to have something special. Then the nightmare started. It was only about 28 miles, but I spent almost two hours to arrive at Holbox. I don't know why the traffic was so horrible that day, or maybe it was just as normal as every day.\n\nFor friends who know me, I don't go to fine dining frequently. I had too much fine dining back in Shanghai. I'd rather find interesting dining spots--inside food courts, at food trucks, etc. Holbox is a Michelin one-star restaurant, but not pricey. Even though it's in a food court and not a traditional restaurant, it's interesting. The food booth doesn't have its own tables in the food court; they're shared with others.\n\nIt's a Mexican food booth. The boss lady--puebla in Spanish--was tough, but not rude. As with most Michelin spots, there was a queue, but it wasn't too long. I grabbed a table stand and found us a place to sit.\n\nNot long after, the food was served. The free tortilla chips had no shining points--just as normal as in every Mexican restaurant. Crispy, flat dipping, better than nothing. Good for snacking after a long drive.\n\nThe food was served one by one, or you could say delivered one by one:\n\nErizo 5/5\nThe word erizo in Spanish means hedgehog, but it can also mean sea urchin. They actually look quite similar. Basically, it's sea urchin. Not everyone likes it--some love it, some hate it. I'm a big fan, uni in Japanese. There were two sea urchins, each with about four or five roes. Underneath were fish and scallop ceviches, but different from normal ceviche--it was lighter, without vinegar or lemon taste, more pure raw seafood. I liked it. Not cheap at $27 for an appetizer.\n\nTaco de Pulpo en su Tinta (Octopus Taco) 5/5\nBasically, it's an octopus taco, mixed with squid ink or cuttlefish in--I couldn't tell. The ink mostly gave it color, with just a faint hint of the sea for flavor. Each taco had a giant octopus tentacle--three tacos on a plate, one tentacle for each. The texture was excellen--soft, tender, not juicy but still moist, not fishy at all. I bet the octopus was stewed for a long time, which made it so tasty. Very good. $7 for three, which I wouldn't call expensive--actually well priced.\n\nPescado a las Brasas 5/5\nFish, who doesn't like fish? A few-bone fish, no tiny bones. The seabass had only one big bone but no tiny bones between the muscles. It was grilled seabass, not heavily marinated but well seasoned. The freshness was its biggest strength.\n\nCilantro Rice and Black Beans 5/5\nThe rice was served with the grilled seabass, dipped in stewed black beans. I had never tried that before, but it was tasty. Not too much cilantro aroma, but still good. The rice itself was perfectly cooked--grains separated, not sticky. Paired with the black beans, it was a great match.\n\nI recommend this food booth in the food court, not only because of its Michelin crown, but also for the way they used squid/cuttlefish ink, how they treated cilantro, lemon, and avocado. They truly put heart into making good food.

Unexpected location in a food court of an easy to miss building, but the food is AMAZING. Staff was kind, attentive, and helpful. Prices are very reasonable.\n\nMost unique dish was the uni served in the sea urchin with scallop ceviche. Just a cool experience and tasted amazing. Uni was just a mildly sweet, creamy, and ocean brine/salt flavor.\n\nI’d 100% get the fish tacos and the blue fin tuna ceviche with tostadas again every time. Both of those were the best of I’ve ever had and were just insanely fresh and flavorful.\n\nThe octopus was GREAT, but just not something I’d get every time.

    "text": "Seeing as this was my first time dining here - I grabbed a little bit of everything. Here is my review by item:\n\nHalibut tostada - 10/10 - Spectacular, by far the best halibut ceviche I have had to date. The fish is premium quality and melt-in your mouth and the exact right amount of citrus to spice.\n\nAtun Tostada (Tuna Ceviche) - 7/10 - Good. The fish is very fresh but the flavor profile of the ceviche mix can use some work. Also, I am a seafood lover and the white-ish sauce paired with the tuna looked unappealing at first presentation, even to me.\n\nTaco de Pulpo en su Tinta (Braised Octopus taco)  - 0/10 - Disgusting!!!! So gross the lingering flavor was making me nauseous on the ride home. (Note: Ive eaten octopus many times - I tried this based on many good experiences). You get a big tortilla with just a piece of crisped (bland) octopus that tasted old and had an extremely gamey flavor. I hated this. Regret ordering it.\n\nScallop Taco - 1/10 - A throwaway dish undeserving of the good money paid for it. Turns out Scallops don’t belong in tacos. Being such a novelty I just had to try it. Huge mistake. Again, the tortilla to filling ratio was way off. All I could taste was bread. The scallops were extremely bland, had a boiled texture - no sear, no char. With only 2 scallops in a thick tortilla, it was like they weren’t even there. Such a waste of perfectly good scallops. Hated this.\n\nAll 3 stars are for the ceviches (tostadas). The cooked seafood is so awful I am insulted I was charged money for them as I feel I should be paid for the trouble of eating them.

The octopus in the ceviche was tender unlike other places that are rubbery and hard to chew, nor was it fishy, so you know it's fresh.\n\nThe kanpachi taco was a bit too salty.\n\nThe green rice that came with the filete al carbon was surprisingly tasty and actually one of our favorite parts.\n\nThe salsas are extremely spicy (rare and appreciated) and best to use as a few droplets rather than lather over the tacos.\n\nAs for the experience, we had read that the lines would be long and went with flexible expectations and acknowledged that it was a possibility we may arrive and not have a chance to try it. Arrived around 11:30 AM on a Thursday and the line was out the door. The parking lot and street parking were full and people there said it would be about an hour wait so we got a printed menu to go (since it changes every day). We did not feel comfortable leaving our cars so far away from view so we stayed inside it, reviewed the menu, called to order, and waited 45 minutes for the food. When we returned to pick up the food, we managed to get a parking spot as a person left. We chose parking for one hour for around $2.75 since 2 hours was around $8. Since it's a food court, we were able to eat our \"to-go\" food anywhere except at the Holbox bar.\n\nThis was our first Michelin star experience and probably one of the most affordable options out there, so we'll definitely recommend it for budget-conscious people looking for exceptionally fresh and quality ingredients. However, the flavor itself was pretty mild and parking is extremely limited, so be prepared to pay with your time (maybe get in line first at 10:30 AM before it opens).

The octopus taco was really well balanced and the smoked fish taco was something I've never tasted before. All over great flavors. The sparkling lemonade is a must! It was refreshing. We got to sit at rje counter and it was perfect. The uchi looks wonderful as well but we opted out since only 1 of us like uchi. The price are super reasonable.

    "text": "2025-\n\nHas been awhile since we been back here.  Had an opportunity to introduce my niece visiting from Minnesota to real seafood and real Yucatán food.  Worth the drive here from the Inland Empire area.  This is located in a food halls where other food stalls.  We went straight to the line, 15-30 min wait.  Ordered at the counter and pick a table and they will bring your food out.\nWe ordered scallops Aguachiles, pulpo a la brasa and Kanpachi collar.  All the dishes are so fresh especially the Scallops are melted in your mom.  They have a condiments station where all the hot sauce is homemade.  Some are spicer than others but all are really good.  Vibrant dining hall and the noise level is pretty decent.  Plenty of off street and designated parking lot.  Have to go again to try other food stalls in this building.\n\nSuch a cute place to dine out.  Food court spot/market with other food counter  options.  The outdoor dining area is so cute.  Easy to find a spot to sit.  They have a small parking lot and also have off street parking as well.   All the ceviche dishes are divine.  The fish taco was crispy and excellent with the variety of hot sauces to bump it up a notch.

The world of tacos is truly vast and deep.\nSurprisingly, it's located inside a food court, and there's even a DMV parking lot next door after 5 p.m., making it convenient for a variety of reasons.\nI had the kanpachi tacos, octopus chaco, seafood ceviche, uni tostada, and lemonade. Each was incredibly fresh and delicious. 😍\nThere's always a long line, so choose a time that's a bit awkward. Food: 5 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 5\n\nFood: 5\nService: 5\nAtmosphere: 5",

Every dish was incredibly fresh, full of flavor, and surprisingly well-priced for the quality. What blew me away is that this is a Michelin Guide stall in a food court. Bravo to the team at Holbox, I can’t wait to come back. Meal type Lunch Price per person $100+ Wait time 10-30 min\n\nMeal type: Lunch\nPrice per person: $100+\nWait time: 10-30 min",

    "text": "Holbox is an absolute gem! This Michelin-star spot serves some of the freshest seafood I’ve had in LA, and the prices are surprisingly democratic for this caliber of food. We tried the smoked kanpachi taco (a must-have—it’s phenomenal), the scallop taco, a lobster dish, sea urchin over scallops, and ahi tuna ceviche. Every single bite was bursting with freshness and flavor.\n\nTheir sparkling lemonade was perfectly balanced—not too sweet—and paired beautifully with the food. I also loved their variety of salsas, each one distinct and thoughtfully crafted to complement the dishes.\n\nWe went on a Saturday around noon and had to wait about 40 minutes, but it was well worth it. Holbox is tucked inside a local mercado, so it doesn’t feel like a stand-alone restaurant, but that only adds to its charm.\n\nI’ll definitely be back to explore more of the menu—and without question for more of those unforgettable smoked kanpachi tacos!

The oysters are pristine and briny, paired simply with salsas and lime that heighten their natural freshness. The ceviche is bright and elegant, perfectly balanced between citrus and herbs. The seafood soup is a standout, a rich and soulful broth layered with shrimp, mussels, and fish, crowned with vibrant cabbage for crunch and contrast. The pulpo/octopus taco is unforgettable, smoky and tender against the earthy blue corn tortilla, lifted by lime and tomato. Holbox captures the essence of coastal cooking at its highest level, refined, soulful and unforgettable. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

The ceviche was a crisp, refreshing reward after a long, hot day. The prawns and scallops in a spicy green aguachile delivered a perfect balance of heat and brightness, while the Maine lobster was pure indulgence, a true showstopper. Even the soft-shell crab impressed with its delicate crunch and depth of flavor.\n\nHolbox isn’t just a meal—it’s a celebration of freshness, creativity, and culinary craftsmanship.

    "text": "Finally got to experience Holbox, and it lived up to the hype. Located inside a food hall, the line can stretch out the door depending on when you arrive, but the counter service setup moves efficiently.\n\nWe ordered: Tostada de Kanpachi & Uni, Sea Urchin, Scallop Aguachile, Smoked Kanpachi Taco, Taco de Pulpo, Blood Clams, and Langosta al Carbón.\n\nEverything was fresh and delicious. The standouts were the tostada, uni, smoked Kanpachi taco, and the grilled lobster. The Uni was fresh and buttery, served in its shell with scallop and an aioli-like sauce of somekind, mouthwatering. Lobster was grilled evenly, pre broken, served with melted butter, avocado tomatoes, and what can go wrong with a live lobster? Nothing, and they weighed the lobster in front of us, let us snap photos despite being so busy which was sweet of them. The smoked kanpachi taco was great with tender fish and a crunchy blue corn shell. The only dishes we wouldn’t order again were the blood clams, and octopus taco. The taco was chewy and the clams just didn't stand out among the rest.\n\nThe food came out as it was ready, so pacing wasn’t ideal, but understandable for this kind of spot.\n\nAll in all, Holbox is absolutely worth a visit. Just try not to get distracted by the empty stalls around it lol Meal type Lunch Price per person $50–100 Food: 5 Service: 4 Atmosphere: 4 Noise level Moderate noise Wait time 10-30 min\n\nMeal type: Lunch\nPrice per person: $50–100\nFood: 5\nService: 4\nAtmosphere: 4\nNoise level: Moderate noise\nWait time: 10-30 min",

    "text": "Came in with high hopes due to the Michelin rating and was not disappointed. My wife and I decided to do a huge sampling of whatever caught our eye on the menu.\n\nThe Spot Prawn and Scallop Aguachile was super fresh (prawns grabbed right out of the tank) and refreshing. The lime cilantro chile sauce was crisp and tasty with a hint of heat. Great summer dish.\n\nBeing a huge ceviche fan we had the Ceviche de Atun. The bluefin tuna was superb. Another well balanced crisp dish that you couldn’t stop eating.\n\nThe star of our meal though was the Tostada de Kanpachi & Uni. An absolute masterpiece. Beautifully layered textures and tastes. The uni was like icing on the cake to some amazing flavors. Even the tostada had amazing flavor. Would come back just for this dish!\n\nThe Pulpo a las Brasas was a pick of mine as I am a sucker for octopus. Super tender with a light char and smokiness. Not sure what the sauce was underneath but it was velvety smokey deliciousness. Even the side of cilantro rice and beans were top notch.\n\nTacos: We had the Baja Fish Taco and the Smoked Kanpachi Taco. Best fish taco I have ever had in my life. Fish was crisp and not greasy. Perfect amount of crema and salsa. The Kanpachi taco was delicious as well but the Baja taco was just a masterpiece of a taco staple. One thing that got my attention in both was the blue corn tortillas. This is what a tortilla is supposed to be. Never had such delicious tortillas in my life. Crazy how the smallest part of the dish can hold up everything and compete in flavor with the exotic ingredients.\n\nAlso enjoyed: we had the sparkling lemonade (tasted more like orange to me). Whatever was in it was amazing and refreshing. Not too sweet.\n\nPricing: who cares. I thought for the level of execution and the quality of ingredients the dishes would be a value at even a higher price point. Great value in my eyes.\n\nUnpretentious culinary adventure in a food hall. Keep doing what you are doing! You have an amazing team kicking out some amazing food!

However the taste and textures disappeared.  The octopus was too soft and mushy, the grilled shrimp was overwhelmed by tomato sauce, and there is spiciness in nearly every dish even though it's not listed on the menu. The scallops on their own tasted good but in the taco not so much. They were sold out of the softshell crab and hamachi collar so come for lunch if you want to catch those.  May come back to try those.",

    "text": "1. Seafood Tostada\n\nA crispy tostada topped with plenty of fresh shrimp and fish! The sauce was a bit strong, but the ingredients were incredibly fresh. It felt like eating a piece of the ocean in one bite.\n\n2. Tuna Tartare\n\nThe crispy minced tuna topped with avocado was visually and flavorfully satisfying. The tortillas provided a variety of textures, and the sauce was beautifully presented.\n\n3. Green Shrimp Aguachile\n\nThe large shrimp and the green sauce were refreshing and tangy. The cucumber and onion complemented each other well, leaving a lasting impression. The flavor could be a bit strong.\n\n4. Raw Oyster Plate\n\nFresh oysters generously served on ice! The basics were perfect, and the three different sauces made it even more enjoyable to enjoy. The refreshing flavor was a bonus.\n\n5. Uni in Sea Urchin Shell\n\nThe visuals were absolutely stunning! However, the strong sauce underneath overshadowed the uni's unique savory flavor, which was a shame. The visual appeal was truly Instagram-worthy.\n\n6. Octopus Grill Plate\n\nThe octopus was chewy on the outside and had a smoky flavor! The grilled lemon, avocado, and tomato salad complemented the dish perfectly, making both the plating and the taste satisfying.\n\n7. Two Tacos (Fish + Octopus)\n\nThe fish taco had a crispy batter and the savory sauce complemented it well. The octopus taco was bursting with smoky flavor! Both were served on blue corn tortillas, adding a unique touch of color.\n\nPicking peas were $8.

    "text": "If you're looking for a seafood experience that feels like a quick trip to the coast of Mexico without leaving California, Holbox is a must-visit. This hidden gem delivers on bold, coastal flavors with an elevated twist.\n\nI tried the uni and scallop tostada, and it was absolutely mind-blowing—so fresh, bright, and beautifully balanced. The wood-grilled octopus was cooked to perfection, tender with just the right char, and the taco de pulpo had this incredible smoky depth that lingered pleasantly.\n\nYou can tell the chef puts a lot of care into the ingredients and presentation. The vibe is casual but refined—perfect for food lovers who want serious flavor without all the fuss.\n\nDon’t skip the agua frescas or the Baja-style oysters. Every bite and sip felt authentic yet innovative. Holbox is a standout for seafood and one of LA’s best-kept culinary secrets. Food: 5 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 5\n\nFood: 5\nService: 5\nAtmosphere: 5",

Wasn’t hard to find a table, plenty of seating for everyone.  Food came out quickly considering how busy they were.  Fantastic presentation.  First bites were great!  Amazing!  Food was very refreshing, very clean, and very satisfying all at once.  However, most dishes have the same salsa in it.  So it got boring after the third dish.  Service was great!   They brought the dishes out to you at the table, and staff was all super nice!  Great overall experience!  Oh ya, churros were nice too!

It is served with the sea urchin and has scallops inside.\n\nThe pulpo was cooked just right! It was not hard, nor chewy. Plenty of flavor, and the dish is served with pesto rice, black beans, avocado and cherry tomatoes mixed with purple onions and a grilled lemon on the side.\n\nFor drink, I went with the sparkling lemonade, and it was so refreshing!\n\nI recommend this spot!

You need to follow up with to make sure that all your order got delivered to the table since they are too busy and they forgot one of our plates.

The flavors are bold, fresh, and layered — and the prices are still super reasonable. Just be ready to wait a bit on weekends, especially during peak hours.\n🔥 Must-tries\nTaco de Pulpo en su Tinta – Not just stunning to look at (hello black taco shell), but packed with flavor. The octopus is tender, and while it leans salty, the squid ink base gives it a deep, savory vibe — almost like olive tapenade.\n\n🔥 Ceviche Mixto – Bright, zesty, and super refreshing. Octopus, shrimp, and sea bass come together with citrus in a way that’s perfect for anyone who loves sashimi or raw bar bites.\n\n🔥 Tostada de Kampachi + Uni –\nThis is your treat yourself moment. Rich, luxe, and ridiculously good.\nThe casual counter setup at Mercado La Paloma adds to the charm — it’s not fancy, but the food easily rivals upscale spots.\n\n💡 Pro tip: Come early, grab a drink while you wait, and make it a mini food adventure.

From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with warm, friendly service and a cozy atmosphere that perfectly blends casual with chic. The ambiance set the tone for what would be an amazing meal.\n\nNow, let's talk about the food – wow! We tried a variety of tacos, and each one was better than the last. The fish taco was incredibly fresh, with a perfect balance of flavors. The shrimp taco was cooked to perfection, plump and juicy, with just the right amount of seasoning. But the real standout for me was the octopus taco – tender and smoky, it had an incredible depth of flavor that really impressed us.\n\nWe also had the uni – it was beyond amazing. Fresh, creamy, and melt-in-your-mouth delicious, it was a true treat for seafood lovers. Each bite was a reminder of just how high the quality of ingredients is at Holbox.\n\nThe tacos alone are worth a visit, but we also couldn’t resist the cocktails, which were perfectly crafted and paired so well with the meal. The staff was attentive but never overbearing, and we felt like they genuinely cared about our experience.\n\nOverall, Holbox is one of those spots where you know you’re going to get high-quality food and service every time. I’ll definitely be coming back to try more of their delicious dishes – it’s worth every penny!

Seating is communal, so it will need to be shared with people dining at the other restaurants, that being said I’ve never had a problem finding a table even for a large group, but that could very depending on which day of the week you’re dining out. I can’t speak too much on the service as they really only bring your food to you and bus your table after you’ve finished. Now the reason why we’re really here is for the food, I would highly recommend the scallop ceviche. It is by far the best dish I have tried. The pulpo taco comes in second for me. Both of these dishes are a must. I’ve tried a few other dishes, but nothing really worth noting, however I still have a list of things I’d like to try.

    "text": "A Michelin rated counter restaurant serving fresh, fresh seafood. In a Mexican food court close to USC and a mere few blocks from the USC/Jefferson Metro stop. Wait in line to order your dishes (grab a menu and be decisive), take a number and find a table.  If seats are open at the counter, grab them. We arrived at 2:30 and no counter seats but by the time we were finished several had opened up.  So if you want to sit at the counter, wait to order until you get a seat.  You still have to order!  Tried the sea urchin with scallops, octopus taco, ceviche mixto, and branzino filet.  All delicious.  There is a parking lot adjacent if you drive.  I think it's free.

    "text": "3.5/5. I’m a bit spilt on Holbox. Many rave about it as it has a Michelin recognition. The food is very fresh as it’s constantly rotating due to the high demand. The menu is somewhat unique and there’s definitely interesting, palatable flavors and ingredients. However, it wasn’t overly delicious or unique enough to scream home about. You could have similar Mexican seafood experience in other mom and Pop restaurants around town. Personally, it wasn’t worth the hype.\n\nThere’s an attempt to have fast service, but you won’t be able to avoid the hour long wait. Longer, including getting your food. The place is located inside a packed and busy food hall, so it can be a struggle to find your own table. Another big thing is sanitation. Due to the high demand, there wasn’t a meticulous practice on keeping the stations, food prep, and cross contamination clean.

I came here solo since I was in LA for the day and one of the workers asked me if it was just me, when I told her yes she told me that I can sit at the bar vs having to continue to wait in the long line. As soon as I sat at the bar they took my order super quickly and everything came out no more then 10 mins later. Although the ceviche had a bit too much onion, it was still really good. The prices weren't too crazy either. I'll definitely come back!

We tried the ceviche mixto, taco de pulpo, smoked kanpachi taco, and the tostada de kanpachi with uni — everything was incredibly fresh and bursting with flavor.\n\nEven with a line, the wait wasn’t bad, and the staff went above and beyond. A team member kindly made sure we got seats at the bar without us even asking again — it felt like they were really looking out for us. The chefs were friendly, knowledgeable, and proud of their craft. They took time to explain dishes and even let me sample the aguachile sauce based on my spice preference.\n\nThe ambiance is casual, market-style, but the energy and passion from the staff make it feel special. Watching someone deliver fresh fish straight into the kitchen was the cherry on top. Big thanks to the entire Holbox team — you made our visit unforgettable!

My favorites might be the smoked kanpachi taco, taco de pulpo en su tinta, scallop taco, and the churros are the best churros I've ever had (which I kind of feel bad for saying bc I've tried churros in Spain). I'm gonna try their entire menu over time, and I'm sure I'm gonna love every single menu item.\n\nBesides the amazing food, the service is also really great!!! In addition, they list all the allergens in their food on the menu, so I was able to take my friend who is gluten-free there without any worries!!\n\nI've brought so many people here since I found out about it 2 weeks ago.\n\nMost of the time the line might get long, but they move fairly quickly.

It was awarded a Michelin star in 2024 and won the Plate Award or Bib Gourmand in previous years. I just came back from South America, so I skipped ceviche, the national dish of South America and Mexico. In addition to the must-order scallops and sea urchins for every table, I strongly recommend \"Scallop Aguachile\", which is scallop chili soup with avocado. A dozen delicious scallops surround the avocado cut into a flower shape, and it is very delicious when soaked in chili sauce. Next time I should try octopus tacos.

    "text": "I had the great pleasure of dining at Holbox, a culinary gem nestled within the vibrant La Paloma market near USC, just south of Downtown Los Angeles. This remarkable restaurant, helmed by the talented and deeply passionate Chef Gilbert Cetina, more than earns its Michelin star distinction.\n\nSeated at the counter, diners are treated not only to an extraordinary meal, but to the mesmerizing theater of preparation, with Chef Cetina personally engaging guests as he crafts each dish with precision and care.\n\nFor an unforgettable experience, I recommend visiting on a Wednesday or Thursday evening, when the eight-course tasting menu is available. Each course is a revelation — inventive, impeccably balanced, and a true celebration of Mexico’s coastal cuisine.\n\nHolbox is, without exaggeration, one of the finest restaurants in Los Angeles, and without question the best Mexican seafood restaurant I’ve ever had the joy of experiencing. The variety of fish is unmatched, with a menu grounded in locally sourced, line-caught seafood, honoring both sustainability and flavor in every bite.

I loved the food from the very first bite of my yellowtail tostada. Their was such an exquisite balance of subtle but abundant flavor. It danced so delicately and made for a gastronomic experience I haven't had eating ceviche. It is hard to put into words how well done the food, how happy the employees are to serve and see you, how welcoming everyone is. It was an awe-inspiring experience all together.

    "text": "Undoubtedly the best seafood in Los Angeles and finally getting their much deserved Michelin star in 2024. I have been wanting to visit Holbox for over two years but never had the chance until now.\n\nIt’s all about fresh seafood with a very latin flavor. Several kinds of ceviches, tacos, and tostadas gave the menu away.  That sweet and citrusy scallop aquachile made me wanted to drink the rest of the juice , and how about an octopus taco (blew my mind away) we just got back from Lisbon and this was equally great.  As food were prepared we just kept saying “wow” as they pass us by we’ll have that next time.  If only we had bigger stomachs but there is always a next time.  And those churros for dessert was so good it brought us back to our favorite churros in Seville.  Located inside a food hall surrounded by equally great latin faire reminds me of a small hawker center in Singapore minus the satay grills. Chef Celina definitely upped the ante and has been consistent in his quality since 2017.\n\nWe came early and first in line which was awesome because as soon as they opened, the line was already snaking around the parking lot. That only tells you great food with no frills, served well is what makes a perfect meal.

Sparkling lemonade goes great with the fish. $1 chips and salsa! Mellow atmosphere in a seat yourself style dining hall with a few other food spots. Small medium parking lot out front.

We weren't expecting to sit at the bar, but they had some seating open (it's very limited). Great service. The home made lemonade is perfectly refreshing. For being Michelin starred, I think one comment is that the two ceviches we got had the same type of flavor. I couldn't really tell the flavors apart between fishes because it was covered by the same ceviche flavor profile. It was delicious nonetheless, but I wonder if other fish dishes on the menu are the same...as I said, I still think about the pulpo. Perfect char, accompanied by the perfect sauce.

We found a seat in the food court, and a short time later my grilled octopus dinner plate, my wife's three tacos, and the sea urchin and scallop ceviche arrived. Looks impressive, but would it hit the mark?\nYES!!! I must say the food far surpassed any expectations I may have had!!!  So much so, I took the 30-mile trip from home again last weekend to try some more Holbox food. This time, I enjoyed the mixed seafood cocktail and three tacos (Baja, aged hamachi, and octopus). My wife went for the grilled octopus plate.\nIn one word, YUM!!!\nIt will not be long before we return again!\nI rank the food as a 5, the service as a 4 (only because I prefer sit-down and waiter service,  and atmosphere a 3 because I think this food deserves a classier spot, but for the quality of the fare, you can't beat the price!\nBRAVO HOLBOX!!!

The crispy shrimp had the right amount of flavour and texture. The sauces went extremely well with the taco. $7-8 for one taco is kind of high, but for these tacos, it’s worth it. They received many awards for their great tasting dishes according to their website. I definitely recommend checking them out.

It’s located in a food hall/market so you order at the counter and they bring the food to you, but there are a few counter seats available as well.\nEverything was super fresh, which you can tell by the fresh fish that are on display in the cooler right behind the chefs. The staff is very helpful and attentive. We spoke with one of the owners Briana and you can tell she has a true passion for what she does.\nWe went here three nights in a row, not for lack of restaurant options as there are plenty to choose from in Los Angeles, but because it was just an amazing experience all around.\nWe tried the scallop Agua Chile, several of the tostadas, all the tacos, the grilled kanpachi collars, coctel de camarones, the scallop and Uni ceviche, and several other dishes. Every single, one of them deserves perfect reviews. Their freshly made blue corn tortillas alone are worth the trip.\nPrices are very modest and won’t break the bank for the quality of food and service that you receive. Add this to your must try list for the next time you’re in LA.

The flavors were bold, authentic, and elevated—everything you’d want from high-quality Mexican cuisine, especially for a wedding. The presentation was beautiful, and the entire meal felt both festive and refined.\n\nDespite some challenges with our venue not allowing them to use the indoor kitchen, the team worked seamlessly with an outdoor kitchen setup we arranged. They handled the situation with complete professionalism, flexibility, and a great attitude. The food was hot, fresh, and incredibly flavorful. From start to finish, everything was clean, well-organized, and sanitary.\n\nOne of the highlights was the late-night tacos—guests loved them! My husband mentioned how much he enjoyed their salsa, and they generously offered him the entire bottle to take home at the end of the night, which was such a thoughtful touch. The desserts were equally incredible—especially the churros, which were made fresh on the spot and absolutely unforgettable.\n\nThere was more than enough food for everyone, and we were even given leftovers to take home. They also handled all the cleanup and removed every bit of trash from the site. Their team was so professional, both in how they dressed and how they interacted with our guests. Even some of our pickiest guests commented on how much they enjoyed the food—which says a lot!\n\nWe highly, highly recommend this vendor for any event.

    "text": "Hidden Gem That Earned Its Star – Holbox, Los Angeles\n\nIG: the_hungry_emil\n\nI've been dining at Holbox inside Paloma Market for years, well before it earned its Michelin star, and it's been consistently exceptional every single time.\n\nThis visit began with the Halibut Tostada, showcasing incredibly fresh fish over a smooth avocado purée with vibrant pico de gallo—light, crisp, and full of flavor.\n\nNext up, the Scallop Aguachile truly impressed. Raw scallops were sweet and briny, perfectly balanced by a zesty green chile-lime sauce, and beautifully presented with red onions and an avocado rose.\n\nI then sampled a trio of tacos:\n\nThe Octopus Taco was unlike any I’ve had—tender grilled octopus served on a deep, savory squid ink sofrito with bright bursts of tomato and chive.\n\nThe Scallop Taco featured a seared scallop, lightly caramelized on the outside, paired with a peppery sauce and shredded lettuce for freshness.\n\nThe Smoked Kampachi Taco came in a crisp shell, delivering a subtle smokiness to the cooked yellowtail—unique and absolutely delicious.\n\nEvery dish reflects a careful blend of traditional Baja flavors with modern technique and elegance. Holbox is a must-visit for anyone who loves Mexican seafood done right—and elevated to fine-dining standards.

    "text": "Everything here is simply fantastic.\n\nI stopped by Tuesday around noon (of course, right at lunch time) and parking was horrendous but I'm sure it's this bad any time of the day considering how small the lot is and how little street parking is available.\n\nThe line was long but moved at a good pace. The cashier was super sweet and offered good recommendations while also explaining the meaning of Holbox when I asked so thank you to her!\n\nI ordered a little bit of everything to get the full range of taste.\n\nFirst up was the ceviche de atuna or tuna ceviche. Wow. Some of the freshest most amazing tuna you'll find, this beats out a lot of sushi restaurants too. The ceviche had great flavor and the chips/tostadas on the side were the perfect pairing. My only minor complaint here was the somewhat off-balance of ceviche mix to tuna. The mix is a bit overpowering and I started picking out more of the tuna, because there was already so much stuck onto each piece.\n\nNext up was the kanpachi tostada. My fault for not eating this right away as the tostada got a bit soggy but wow - another stellar dish. The uni was the cherry on top to add a textural change as well as that ocean freshness.\n\nThe baja fish taco has to be one of the best fish tacos, even one of the best tacos I've ever had in LA. Simply done even at Michelin standards. The fish was light and so crispy, the tortilla was soft and fresh, and the salsa was perfect.\n\nLastly and another amazing dish - the smoked kanpachi quesadilla. The Kanpachi was sooo good and light, it was cheesy and the salsa added so much depth of flavor.\n\nThis place is a must for any Mexican and seafood lover Meal type Lunch Price per person $20–30 Food: 5 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 5 Reservation Reservations not required\n\nMeal type: Lunch\nPrice per person: $20–30\nFood: 5\nService: 5\nAtmosphere: 5\nReservation: Reservations not required",

    "text": "Holbox might just be the best food court or fast-casual dining experience you’ll ever have. The quality coming out of this kitchen far exceeds what you’d expect from a counter-service setup—it’s almost a mismatch in the best possible way.\n\nOrdering was smooth and easy, and the food arrived quickly. Chips and salsa were served first, which was a nice touch while we waited for the main dishes.\n\nThe setting can be seen as either charming or simply casual, but either way, there’s ample seating in the food court, so finding a table isn’t an issue.\n\nWhile I personally find this style of casual dining a bit unglamorous—and wish I could enjoy a cold beer with my ceviche—I recognize that the stripped-down setup keeps overhead low, and that value is clearly passed on to the customer.

The sea urchin was rich, fresh, and beautifully presented. As for the tacos: the scallop, smoked kanpachi, Baja fish, and Baja shrimp were all packed with flavor and perfectly cooked. I also had the limonada, which was crisp and refreshing. Every dish felt thoughtful and vibrant. I left so satisfied and already can’t wait to come back to try more.

I also got the grilled branzino that came with rice and black beans as well as handmade tortillas. The branzino was fresh and stuffed with some onions. I also got chips and salsa which were fab. To drink, I got the sparkling lemonade which wasn’t overly sweet. I love that this was an affordable and delicious dining option.

    "text": "Holbox – A Missed Catch in a City Full of Great Tacos\n\nI really wanted to love Holbox. It’s one of LA’s most talked-about spots—Michelin-starred, James Beard–nominated, raved about on every food blog worth its salt. But for us, it just didn’t land.\n\nFrom the start, service was disorganized. Our dessert arrived before our food, and we had to flag down three different team members just to get our order. They did refund the dessert—which we appreciated—but honestly, it wasn’t worth serving in the first place. The cheesecake was dense, dry, and flavorless. It felt like an afterthought in a place that shouldn’t be mailing anything in.\n\nThe lobster dish was a real letdown. Coming from a coastal town where lobster is a way of life, I was excited—but what arrived was chewy and overcooked. The rice and beans alongside it were actually great, but not what you come here for.\n\nMichael ordered an assortment of tacos. The scallop taco was undercooked and had an off taste. The smoked kampachi taco had a cool concept, but wasn’t something either of us wanted more than a bite of. The Baja shrimp taco? That one was solid—but LA is a city of incredible tacos. If you’re going to be one of the top taco spots here, you really have to bring it. Holbox didn’t.\n\nThe ceviche was the one bright spot in terms of taste. The fish was fresh and well-marinated, but it was plated in a way that felt messy and overwhelming. The portion was huge and oddly presented—more cafeteria scoop than culinary elegance.\n\nThe fryer oil was another surprise. I have a soybean allergy—to boot—so I couldn’t even try some of the items, including the chips and fish tacos I was most excited about. They use a blended oil with soybean in their fryer, which was really unfortunate.\n\nThere’s a lot of potential here—fresh fish, inventive ideas, a casual setup that’s very LA. But execution matters, and for us, it just didn’t deliver.\n\nIn the end, the best things I had were my Diet Coke, the rice and beans, and a taco I couldn’t even eat. It’s safe to say we won’t be returning. If we ever do find ourselves back at this market, we’ll be trying the other counters instead.

In multiple visits I think it's still amazing but sometimes a bit hit or miss. Favs: scallop aguachile, octopus tacos. I found the seafood soup a bit underwhelming and have had times when the uni wasn't very good. It can be really hard to find a table in the food court.\n\nPro tip: get a watermelon agua fresca from the stand across the way for the spice. And the Asian spot has great noodles for kids.

In additional to sampling a few tacos and tostadas (I prefer the tacos in terms of the vehicle for the seafood - the tortilla is really soft and supple), we also splurged on the uni, which came freshly cracked open and loaded with scallop. What also shocked me was how good the DESSERT was - one of the best churros I've ever had, pillowy and the chocolate sauce was just the right consistency and sweetness. Service was great and there was plenty of seating in the food hall. Overall, an excellent meal!

As much as seasonal items and produce are available as specials a la carte, the extra attention, planning and cookery involved in the tasting menu is quite special. Also chef Gilberto is so friendly and I appreciate all the explanations of all that goes into each dish from the sourcing of the seafood to intricate methods of preparation.

The space is democratic with an order line  and counter seating, so plan to stand in line until it's your turn to order. The sea urchin is perfect and so are their octopus tacos. So delicious when washed down with a nice cold passion fruit juice from the stand across the hall.

The waitress ignored the fact that I asked for 4 cups with ice. She brought 2 with no ice. I assumed she would bring us additional utensils when the food came out but she didn’t. I had to ask another server to bring the additional utensils. Noticed the table behind me had the same issue. Please train your servers to have the common courtesy to bring enough utensils. We already patiently waited to be serviced and receive  our food. The ceviche plate came quick. Warm food took longer but that was fine. The server made the experience bad.

You can taste the freshness of the seafood in there. It wasn't fishy and the clams were so good and easy to get to the meat inside. There was a line but it's to be expected as it is Michelin rated. Once you place your order at the counter they will give your number and bring your food to your table. I will try\nthe tacos next time and let you know.

I'd say my favorite tacos were the pulpo and Baja fish ones. The fish was super tender and juicy and came with a little basket of tortillas to eat it with. My favorite part was the churros, which were hot and crunchy, but soft and fluffy on the inside. They had a dark chocolate dipping sauce that went well with the sugary churros.",

I found street parking easily on a weekday. The seafood was definitely fresh and yummy. I tried their octopus taco, smoked kanpachi taco, uni/kanpachi tostada, and shrimp aguachile. My fav was probably the tostada, but I have to say the uni was lost in the strong flavors of the ceviche. I'd say try any of the ceviche options to be satisfied.\n\nTheir operation is clearly well run, affordable for what the menu is, and presentation is amazing. But I was expecting more from the flavors. I didn't find any of the flavors innovative or new. Their tacos are simple and that's an item that can easily be experimented on. They have a good sized menu. I wish it was smaller and even more simple to showcase the fresh seafood or have more experimental/innovative options on the menu. Overall it was a good seafood experience. I'm not sure how I'd feel if I had to battle a weekend line. Also, not sure if I'd go out of my way to come back on my own, but for sure with newcomers. I'd love to try their other ceviche options.

If you're going to come here, aim for off-peak hours or come early. Got the Ceviche Mixto, Kanpachi and Uni Tostada, and Baja Fish Taco. Everything was perfect. Their octopus and scallop are exceptional. Everything else was honestly on par with other good, non-Michelin taco spots.\n\nI will say, only the line is a long wait. After your order, they actually bring your food out pretty quickly, and they'll bring it out as it's ready.

Portions were also substantial.\n\nHighlight: kanpachi ceviche (portion was huge and tostadas nice and crispy) and the tuna tostada\n\nOnly thing that lacked a little was the octopus taco. The flavors were great, but the octopus was a little dry and not very large pieces.\n\nBe prepared for a line. We waited around 30ish minutes at 2:00 on a Sunday. However, it is well worth the wait!

    "text": "I had very high expectations for Holbox but I left quite disappointed. The Branzino seabass was mediocre at best, it lacked flavor and texture. The taco de pescado al carbon was a bit dry and the Baja shrimp taco was sadly overcooked and bland. Shrimp cannot be overcooked on any dish at a Michelin star hyped restaurant. We also tried the kanpachi uni tostada which was pretty good and worth a try but not the most memorable tostada I’ve ever had. The atmosphere was typical of a Mercado which is fine but the food did not impress or warrant the time invested in its wait.

    "text": "Extremely disappointed in the Holbox experience. The food was decent at best with no one dish truly standing out. I had the cóctel mixto, the pecado a las brasas (sea bass), tostada de Kanpachi & Uni, taco de pescado al carbón, baja shrimp taco, and a lemonade.\n\nThe standout dish among those was the kanpachi & uni tostada but that not saying much considering all the dishes were of average quality. I expected more from the hype and was disappointed.  As I looked around the Mercado I realized that people had exceptional dishes from the other restaurants in the market. The atmosphere was typical of a Mercado, busy and loud, which is fine. However, the food left a lot to be desired given the Michelin acclaim and hype. I honestly believe the star isn’t justified and it was likely awarded because of where the restaurant is located (South L.A) and let’s face it, someone in the hood had to get a star.

Mariscos Jalisco) and also better food of similar cuisine in Toronto. It was fine, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here. On a positive note, the food comes pretty quickly despite being perpetually busy but it is easy to get forgotten due to the busyness (eg. we got our chips and salsa way after we got our main dishes).

The food was insanely good, beautifully presented and big portions that are actually very good value for the price. Every single item was extremely fresh and delicious.

There was 7 of us and we all ordered separately so maybe a little confusing, but they didn't deliver one person's tacos, and accidentally delivered 4 rice that we didn't order.\n\nOtherwise the food was great.  My favorite was the Scallop Aguachile, Smoked hamachi tostada, and the scallop Taco.  The cerviche and Aguachile were large portions could easily be shared among 3-4.  Tacos were best bang for the buck.

    "text": "Went here on a Friday afternoon at opening. There was already a line to get in. However, you can also sit at the counter and get table service there. I found an empty seat and took advantage. It's located in a food court, so expect a packed house.\n\nI was helped quickly by a gentleman. I started off with a sparkling lemonade and a taco de pulpo en su tinta. The taco was very good. The octopus was tender and went well with the calamari ink sofrito. Next I got a tostada de atun. Bluefin tuna, avocado puree and arbol peanut sauce. The combination of all 3 were great! And the homemade tostada was easy to eat. Didn't crumble at any bites, so you're enjoying every component of the plate. Lastly, I got an entrée of pulpo a la brasa. The smokiness of the octopus combined with the almond pipian was spot-on! Combine that to make a taco with the baby tomatoes and avocado slices it was a perfect combo!\n\nOverall, a great experience at $57.00. The server was attentive, although his attitude changed after my 15% tip. It's all good. Doesn't take away from the overall experience. I highly recommend coming here.

    "text": "Wife and I went for early dinner around 3:30 on Sunday (1/19/25). Got a parking spot right away. There was already a 20 deep line just for Holbox. Ordered around 4 pm the grilled octopus plate (pulpo a las brasas), grilled kanpachi collars and a cold halibut tostada (tostada de lenguado). Attentive servers delivered chips and salsa right away. Food started arriving in 20 minutes. Halibut tostada was awesome and fresh. Octopus plate with habanero sauce was just the best...no rubbery morsel here!!! My wife thoroughly enjoyed the fish collar. In between, the wait staff were quick to add a baja fish taco my wife wanted to try. I would go back just to have the same dishes let alone try other items on the menu!! Gave ambiance only 4 stars because Holbox wasn't the only restaurant in the mercado plaza...but it was the primary attraction. BTW, when we left around 5:30 the line was even longer!!

This honestly has to be top 5-10 best meals I've ever had in my life. Seriously. The seafood is so fresh and melts in your mouth. I had the garlic butter shrimp plate with the grilled bread, cilantro rice, and beans, and the flavor of the shrimp sauce was AMAZING. Since I was hungry, I had an array of different items, including the Tostada with the Kampachi, shrimp, and another fish, and it was out of this world!! The salsas are soooo good! The guacamole was cool (maybe needed a pinch of salt). But the showstopper were the CHURROS. Oh my god!!! Those Churros with the chocolate sauce? INSANE!!! Honestly, I'm going back again before I leave but seriously, this place is beyond words. The prices are reasonable but also range, depending on the dish and it's worth every penny. This place is deserving of its Michellin star and more. Thank you for creating this magical place. Holbox, I love you!!! Food: 5 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 5\n\nFood: 5\nService: 5\nAtmosphere: 5",

    "text": "This seafood-infused Mexican cuisine is truly unique. Many locals come here and say every dish is delicious. The seafood is incredibly fresh, and it feels like there's no menu. The presentation is excellent, and the seasoning is fantastic. Most importantly, it's incredibly affordable and offers excellent value. The chef was recently featured in a GQ profile.

Highly recommend arriving before the 11:30am opening if you don’t wish to deal with parking, the queue, and finding a table.

    "text": "What can one say about Holbox? It is in a big food court. It has gotten a lot of press, and has a Michelin star. I will start with the food, but I have a lot to say about the experience.\n\nYou can upload the menu on your phone or get someone in your group to grab a menu. It is good to use your wait time in the long line to the ordering counter wisely. Send others to grab drinks from another vendor. Buy a few tacos from another vendor if you are hungry.\n\nWe tried a lot of dishes. The Baja shrimp taco is traditional, but the shrimp are huge and moist, and the crema and toppings are great. Also quite good was the tostado de jurel. It is yellowtail ceviche, avocado, and an almond salsa on a very crispy corn tortilla base. It was fresh, sour, savory, and yummy. I found the scallop aguachile to be a bit too lime forward, which tends to drown out the sweetness of scallops, but if you eat it with the pieces of avocado and chips, it mellows everything out. Needless to say, all the seafood is bright and fresh.\n\nMy companions really loved the smoked kanpachi tacos, all hot and cheesy, and spicy. The camarones al mojo were sensational. This is a main dish platter, so comes with excellent black beans and cilantro rice, plus toasted bread for sopping up the marinade. The shrimp were HUGE and perfectly prepared. So all in all, the food is terrific.\n\nSo the downsides: You will pretty much have a 30 to 45 minute wait before you can order. You will need to hunt out a table in the loud, noisy, and not very clean dining hall. The food comes out in no particular order. This makes the actual dining rather chaotic. Our 6 items cost over $100. Michelin star or not, to me, how I am served and the atmosphere in which I eat makes a difference. Is the food great? Yes. Does eating it amid the chaos make it less nice? Yes, absolutely.\n\nI have eaten at a lot of Michelin started restaurants all over the world. Does this rate a Michelin star? I don't think so. But I do recommend eating here. The food is just terrific.

    "text": "The joke about Michelin rated restaurant is you pay a boatload of money for couple morsels that you thought were appetizers but you just ate the dinner.  Well, no worries here, this place serves real food that you actually recognize.  Ordered grilled whole seabass and octopus; both came on a wood plank , nicely “plated “.  Octopus was tasty moist and soft, the seabass was perfectly grilled that you can lift the fillet off the bone in one piece.  The corn tortillas were soft and fresh.  Nice. Not cheap but well worth it.\nThe place actually is a food court with other food stalls so don’t go to the wrong counter, seating is shared and don’t expect table cloths or linen.\nWent there again for lunch before the basketball game . Highly recommend smoked kanpachi and scallop tacos.  Pulpo is good too.\nAgain, this place is a food court so don’t expect romantic lightings and table cloths.

It was off the charts delicious and a great price. I had the grilled whole Branzino with everything, and Sandi had some of the best Baja Shrimp Tacos ever! The wait wasn’t long as we thought it would be. There was some sort of Mexican Fiesta ma going on, so I snapped a video!! I will definitely be coming back, often. The USC Game was great too.

    "text": "Fresh wood-grilled fish is the best, but I often get their Baja style tacos or the scallop taco.   Civeches are wonderful. The fish soup is also excellent with its various seafood content. Many other wonderful dishes, oysters, cocktail,  branzinos. Earned Michelin Bib Gourmand two years in a row. One of the best seafood restaurants in Los Angeles without the hefty prices. Situated  in the Mercado la Paloma. I highly recommend this place. Chef Gilberto has been nominated for the James Beard Award for Chef of the year. Holbox is expanding its counter space for more seating and an open kitchen concept. HOLBOX was no. 1 Los Angeles restaurant last year and is no. 5 this year. It has also earned a Michelin Star this year\nThis is no small feat and tells of incredible and tasty foods and a testament to the creativity of Chef Gilberto. Closed on Mondays, otherwise the line to order food is constant. Come and try it!

    "text": "Been coming here before the Times review and the Michelin recognition and the place continues to serve good fresh Mexican style seafood.  Too bad it’s so over exposed now- the place can get busy.  The food is typical of seafood you might get in Baja or mainland Mexico (but more refined than a typical street counter), so to me it’s not a mind blowing experience, or anything new (wonder if the Michelin reviewers are a bunch of gringos?) I’ve had stellar seafood in Mexico- perhaps even better from street stands; however, this is one of my go to places when I need a good authentic seafood fix without the drive down to Baja or to try differnt places from East LA.  The cocktail here is good (I’ve had better from seafood trucks); the fish tacos are good (not as good as an Ensenada fish taco); the ceviche is great- generous portions with high quality fish- the style is not as tangy as a Peruvian style ceviche, but recommended.  The octopus taco is one of my favorites.    Definitely worth a visit- but I recommend angelenos venture out to other Mexican seafood options in LA to experience authentic food options that are just as tastey as well.  (I digress) Media hype can ruin a place, thankfully, this place maintains high quality food.

Once there, the wait staff took our order right away and we were given chips and salsa to munch on while we waited.\n\nTaco De Pulpo En Su Tinta - Amazingly soft, well seasoned and extremely tasty.  A must order.\n\nScallop Aguachile - A bit tart, but so refreshing and perfect melding of flavor and texture between the scallops and avocado.  A very recommended order.\n\nErizo Sea Urchin Uni - Incredibly fresh sea urchin atop fish and scallops ceviche?  Who says no to that?  A very recommended order.\n\nSopa De Mariscos - I'm not a good judge of seafood soups because I love them all, but I feel confident in saying this is maybe one of the best I've ever eaten.  Make sure you dip that grilled bread, I think it's the best way to enjoy this dish honestly.

    "text": "My husband and I recently had the pleasure of dining at Holbox for lunch during a whirlwind weekend in LA, and I can confidently say that the experience was nothing short of spectacular! The food was absolutely delightful—each dish was succulent and bursting with flavor, leaving me craving more.\n\nWhile we started with the classic guacamole, we also tried the Baja and shrimp tacos simply because the line moved so fast we didn't get a chance to review the menu. Holbox operates like a well-oiled machine, ensuring fast and attentive service that perfectly complements the delightful food. I was particularly impressed with the portions of the seafood soup, and the smoked kampachi tostado was a treat for anyone who enjoys that rich, smoky flavor. However, the true stars of the meal were the bluefin ceviche and the kampachi and uni tostado. They were so exquisite that, despite being full, I simply couldn’t help but savor every last bite. A big thank you to Gilberto for recommending the ceviche—it was a highlight of my culinary adventure!\n\nAs I left, I found myself already planning a return trip to try the abalone, lobster, and octopus. A girl can only eat but so much in one sitting. 😆\n\nGilberto, I look forward to seeing you in my city soon at Zahav!

I was looking forward to trying this restaurant since they got a Michelin star.\nI ordered three tacos at the counter and seated there for around 25 minutes, the food was still not coming, I asked one of the staff and they went back behind the counter and checked, I saw they brought out the plates that were already sitting by the kitchen for dont know how long. When the food came, they’re already cold. Instead of checking with the customer who seated there waiting for that long, they chose to just let the food getting cold…The taste of the food was not bad but definitely not special. The service and the environment don’t deserve a Michelin star. I understand that when your restaurant gets a star, it will become very popular, but it doesn’t mean that you have to sacrifice the guest experience and customer service. I guess they will only concern about you when you order the tasting menu that is over $100 per person…I would rather go to Guerrilla Taco in downtown LA, at least you receive good service, sit at proper environment and get food with reasonable pricing.

Personally, I think it was worth the hype!\n\nThe food was excellent and as the chef walked us through each dish, it was amazing to see how much thought goes into sourcing each ingredient. Some of the dishes are now in my personal Hall of Fame Bites (kanpachi crudo, abalone tamale), and the shrimp and spiny lobster meat were the most delicate and sweet I've ever had. I thought it was very reasonably priced for everything I got, and I left feeling the perfect amount of full.\n\nI'm going to return and try things off the regular menu!

The restaurant is inside a building with a group of restaurants but is the first on the left as you enter.  We ordered several plates to share and enjoyed every dish immensely. The ceviche de camaron was amazing as was the uni tostada and pulpo platter and finally the Baja fish taco.  Mexican cokes are served in bottles and are huge.  The tortilla chips and salsa served prior to the entrees coming out was delicious as well.\nPrices are competitive and the parking while difficult to find is in a private lot that was full when we arrived and we had to wait in a small line to get a spot as customers left.\n5 stars easily and two enthusiastic thumbs up for Holbox!  ¡Muchas gracias!

(Did I mention there was only one scallop, sliced into three portions?) And the octopus was just okay. Sadly, I think it's mostly over priced, underwhelming hype, with sexy, miniscule portions.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I got the ceviche de atún, tostada de kanpachi + uni, erizo (live sea urchin with scallop), pata de mula (blood clams), and scallop aguachile.\n\nThe ceviche, tostada, and aguachile all had a repetitive flavor profile, with a heavy emphasis on citrus. It felt like we were tasting variations of the same dish, which got a little boring. The blood clams were a hard pass for me--they tasted like mole and just didn't sit well. The erizo was underwhelming; I was hoping for something more exciting.\n\nOne odd thing was the accompanying packets of crackers they gave with nearly all the dishes—they just didn’t work well at all. I think these dishes are much better with tortilla chips instead. On the plus side, the food comes out quickly, and the line can get long, but it moves fairly fast. Just a heads-up that the service is kind of non-existent; it's pretty much self-serve. You have to get your own water, hot sauce, and napkins. When we asked one of the food runners for more napkins, she said yes but never came back.\n\nThe freshness of the seafood here is undeniable, but I wouldn't recommend going out of the way to try this place.

They have a self serve sauce station with 5 different sauces. We loved the dark one (didn’t get the name of it) as it had a nice smoky flavor but not too much heat.\n\nThe standout dishes to us were the octopus taco (pulpo), baja fish taco, tuna tostada, and  mesquite grilled branzino with rice, beans, and tortillas (filete al carbon). We liked how they had blue corn tortillas, which complemented the seafood really well!\n\nI would recommend coming early if you don’t want to wait in line for too long. We arrived around 11:15 and were among the first group of people to be seated. By the time we left, the line was out the door!

This was the best food I’ve had in LA so far — we ordered fairly reasonably priced items and felt incredibly satisfied leaving. I was able to have perfectly crunchy and soft bites of the Baja Fish Taco, which tasted even more delicious topped with the extra hot sauces that are provided by the counter. I also got to try the Baja Shrimp Taco which offered very different flavors, but made you feel like you were eating seaside. The Filete al Carbon was another good one — plenty of beans and rice and avo with a healthy filet of branzino. Would recommend splitting a few different dishes if you’re going with someone else! The market was bustling but we found seating easily and it was enjoyable to be around other people that were loving the taste of their food, too.

The roasted habanero salsa was a killer but very addictive.\n\nThen we got the scallop aguachile and soft shell crab, both of which were perfectly done. The scallops were especially fresh, and the aguachile was well balanced between spicy, zesty, and refreshing.\n\nThen we finished with two tacos and a seafood stew. All of which were amazing. The stew had a thick, flavorful saffron infused broth that imparted a ton of extra flavor to the seafood. The tortillas they used for the tacos were great too and clearly homemade.\n\nOverall, an outstanding spot worth a visit. As visitors from NYC, we were super glad we stopped by.

We went with 1 of each kind of taco(shared them to taste each one), the halibut ceviche, and the scallop Aguachile with the sparkling lemonade. Just wow 12/10. The flavors were so amazing and refreshing and blended together so well. The fish tacos really stuck out they were the more simple of all the tacos but everything went together so perfectly, highly recommend. The smoked kanpachi taco also stood out as one of my favorites. You can’t go wrong with anything on the menu really. We were visiting from out of town from the Bay Area and I would legit take another trip down there just to eat at Holbox.

    "text": "We drove all the way from Lake Forest to try Hobox, recently awarded a Michelin star, and located in a food court. There was a line stretching to the door, but it moved fairly quickly. After ordering, we grabbed a number and found a seat by the door. Unfortunately, things took a turn when the line was moved inside, right next to our table. It was loud and awkward to eat with people standing so close, so we had to relocate mid-meal. Thankfully, shortly after we moved, they relocated the line back outside to address the same concerns other diners had.\n\nAs for the food, we started with the sparkling lemonade, which was wonderfully bubbly with a perfectly balanced sweet and acidic flavor. It tasted freshly squeezed with no artificial coloring, giving it a very homemade feel.\n\nNext, we received complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were freshly fried and crunchy, but the salsa was a bit too acidic for my taste.\n\nWe ordered the uni and kanpachi tostada, which had simple yet effective flavors of salt, pepper, and lime juice that allowed the freshness of the fish and uni to really shine.\n\nThe ceviche mixto had a similar flavor profile—salt, pepper, lime juice, finely chopped onions, tomatoes, cilantro, and a mix of fresh fish, shrimp, and octopus. While the seafood was undeniably fresh, I found it too salty and lacking in umami. A touch of sweetness and more depth would have made it more enjoyable. The tostada that accompanied the ceviche was light, airy, and perfectly crunchy—not your typical tostada, which was a nice surprise.\n\nFor the tacos, the scallop tacos were absolutely delicious. The scallops were tender, and the pickled onions and grilled cherry tomatoes added just the right amount of acidity to balance the dish. The octopus tacos were the highlight. Perfectly cooked octopus paired with calamari ink sofrito created an unforgettable dish—one of the best octopus taco I’ve ever had. They did forget to remove the bay leaf from the sofrito, though I’m not sure if that was intentional.\n\nWe also tried the Taco de Pescado al Carbon, featuring mesquite grilled Baja California kanpachi, mayo, morita sauce, cabbage, pico de gallo, and avocado puree. The fish was tender, but the skin was a little too chewy for my taste—I would have preferred it to be crunchier.\n\nThe shrimp tacos, while decent, didn’t particularly stand out. They featured battered fried shrimp, garnish, and mayo, which was good but nothing extraordinary.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience trying unique dishes, and I’d definitely return. Next time, I’ll stick to the hot tacos and skip the ceviche unless they add more umami. Food: 4 Service: 4 Atmosphere: 3\n\nFood: 4\nService: 4\nAtmosphere: 3",

    "text": "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n“A Culinary Symphony: Tacos that Transcend Reality!”\n\nOh, Holbox, you ethereal beacon of culinary excellence! Nestled within the vibrant Mercado La Paloma, this unassuming gem has redefined my understanding of what it means to truly live. I came here for a simple business meeting, but little did I know, I was about to embark on a gastronomic journey so profound that it would forever change the way I perceive the humble taco.\n\nLet me start with the fish tacos—oh, the fish tacos! These aren’t just tacos, my friends; these are divine creations, descended from the heavens, kissed by the sea, and delivered to your plate with the grace of a thousand angels. The fish, perfectly crisp on the outside, yet tender and succulent within, was embraced by a tortilla so divine it could be the fabric of the gods themselves. And that ceviche? A burst of oceanic bliss that sent my taste buds into an ecstatic frenzy, dancing and singing praises to the culinary gods!\n\nI found myself utterly mesmerized, unable to focus on the matters of business at hand. My associate, equally ensnared by the spell of Holbox, could only nod in agreement as we devoured these masterpieces in a shared state of euphoria.\n\nBut, alas, the path to paradise is not without its trials. The parking situation? A labyrinthine ordeal, forcing me to traverse nearly 300 meters from my vehicle to the gates of this culinary Eden. The prices? Not for the faint of heart, but let me assure you, every single penny was worth the price of admission to this nirvana of flavor.\n\nAnd yes, the wait—oh, the wait—was long and torturous. Yet, like a true pilgrimage, the reward at the end was nothing short of transcendent. This is one of those rare places where the hype is not just met but exceeded in every possible way.\n\nSo, to all my fellow food lovers, hear me now: Being a foodie may be a euphemism for being a little greedy, but at Holbox, it’s an indulgence that will feed your soul. Go forth, and eat those tacos, my friends. Eat those tacos!\n\nLocation: 3655 S Grand Ave, Ste C9, Los Angeles, CA 90007\nWebsite: Holbox Los Angeles\n\nEnjoy!

    "text": "Holbox is an absolute gem! Went there the other night and finally understand why it got that Michelin nod for 2024. The vibe is relaxed, yet the food is out of this world.\n\nWe ordered a bunch of tacos to try: Smoked Kanpachi Taco - wow, the smoky flavor was just right. Then there was the Taco de Pulpo en su Tinta, which was an explosion of rich, tangy ink sauce paired with perfectly cooked octopus. The Taco de Pescado al Carbon had that amazing char-grilled flavor, and the Scallop Taco - so tender and fresh, I honestly wanted another round of those. The Baja Fish Taco didn’t disappoint either; crispy and flavorful, just how it should be.\n\nFor sharing, we got the Pulpo A Las Brasas and Coctel Mixto. The grilled octopus (Pulpo A Las Brasas) was a standout - tender, with a crispy exterior and packed with flavor. The Coctel Mixto was a delightful, refreshing mix of seafood that balanced out the richer dishes perfectly.\n\nOverall, Holbox delivered an incredible dining experience with every single dish. It’s definitely a must-visit for anyone looking to explore high-end Mexican fusion food. Can't wait to go back and try more!

    "text": "Holbox Los Angeles is an exceptional culinary destination that delivers a high-quality dining experience, worthy of its Michelin star. Nestled within Mercado la Paloma, a historic landmark brimming with culture and a variety of unique food offerings, this restaurant provides a unique and memorable dining experience.\n\nI began my meal with the Taco de pulpo en su tinta, a delightful dish featuring braised and fried Gulf of Mexico octopus. The octopus was tender and perfectly cooked, enhanced by the rich, savory calamari ink sofrito. The depth of flavor in this dish was outstanding, with each bite revealing a nuanced blend of textures and tastes that truly highlighted the quality of the ingredients.\n\nNext, I indulged in the Scallop taco, a masterpiece of pan-seared Maine diver scallops. The scallops were succulent and cooked to perfection, accompanied by a vibrant salsa \"x'catic\" that added a touch of heat. The caramelized onions, tomato, and marinated fennel provided a sweet and tangy contrast, elevating the overall flavor profile of the dish. The combination of these elements created a harmonious and sophisticated taste that lingered pleasantly on the palate.\n\nThe Cóctel mixto was another highlight, featuring a mix of wild Mexican shrimp, Gulf of Mexico octopus, and Baja bay scallop. The seafood was fresh and succulent, and the house-made sweet and sour cocktail sauce added a refreshing and zesty touch. The balance of sweetness and acidity in the sauce complemented the natural flavors of the seafood beautifully, making this dish a refreshing and satisfying option.\n\nThe ambiance at Holbox is charming and laid-back, set within the vibrant environment of Mercado la Paloma. The market itself is a treasure trove of cultural experiences, offering a diverse array of food choices. It's a great place to explore and soak in the rich cultural tapestry of Los Angeles.\n\nHolbox's approach to customer service is unique, with a casual system where food and drinks are dropped off at your table, rather than traditional waiter service. This setup adds to the relaxed atmosphere, allowing diners to enjoy their meal at their own pace without the formality of a traditional restaurant.\n\nOverall, my experience at Holbox was delightful. Each dish showcased a thoughtful blend of high-quality ingredients and innovative flavors, making it clear why this establishment has earned a Michelin star. The ambiance and service add to the experience, making it a must-visit for anyone looking to explore the rich culinary landscape of Los Angeles.

I feel like it could have been a little less time-consuming, but they corrected their weaknesses with the freshness of their dishes. It feels like you're eating them fresh from the sea.\n\nRegarding the dishes and presentation, they could improve a bit for what you pay, however, I can't adjust my rating based on minor details, considering the space, location, and high demand. I was served by a white-haired girl and the cashier was a tall woman with glasses, and I truly felt at home. Don't miss this opportunity; it was worth every hour spent traveling from Santa Barbara to reach such a splendid place. I will definitely return as soon as possible.

However, the person who handed me the food was pleasant. While the food tasted good, the portions were quite small, and I feel like you could get better value and experience elsewhere. The hype around Holbox may not be deserved, as I traveled quite far to experience it and was left disappointed.

The ceviche is also a flavor that all Koreans would like. The fish tacos and kanpachi tacos were more delicious than the octopus tacos. And the salsa sauce was incredibly delicious.\n\nThere is a self-service bar with various hot sauces made in the restaurant behind the ordering area, so you can use them for free.\n\nHowever, since it is a famous restaurant, there are many people, so most of the time there are many customers during meal times.

    "text": "I had a smoked kanpachi taco, a scallop taco, and a tostada de jurel with guacamole on the side. They also gave us tortilla chips on the house. If you are okay with raw fish, I personally suggest the tostada I had; the ceviche inside it was delicious. The taste of the smoked kanpachi taco was unique and worth trying. If you do not like raw fish, this place may not be for you, as most of the options on the menu contain raw fish.

We ordered the tuna ceviche to share and then 2 tacos each. The octopus taco was a highlight, as well as the grilled fish one! The smoked kanpachi was also good, but didn’t give off the taste of fish. Atmosphere is quaint and casual. The quality of the fish is excellent! Would definitely come back!

The scallops were large pieces with avocado and a lime chili cilantro seasoned chili water. So good! The whole grilled branzino was great! So moist and flavorful. The catch of the day blue fin tuna ceviche was tasty with big pieces of fresh tuna. And the smoked mixed fish tostada with peanut sauce. The sauce is killer! And the sauces, the habanero so bright and floral. And they grow their own microgreens.

    "text": "After returning the rental car and taking an Uber back to my accommodation, I happened to come across a building with a cool mural. I looked it up on Google Maps and found this restaurant, and strangely enough, I really liked it. I didn’t know it was closed on Mondays, so I went there in vain, but I went back on Wednesday and enjoyed a delicious meal. When I looked at Google Maps, I couldn’t tell if it was a Michelin restaurant, but I think I was very lucky. This restaurant uniquely serves Mexican food from the Yucatan Peninsula. They handle seafood very well, and most of all, they are very spicy. The price is a bit high, but I definitely recommend you try it at least once.

I've tried almost everything on the menu. The oysters are top notch. The ceviches as fresh as any I've had. My mouth is still burning from the aguachile, but there's no question about the quality. Even the Baja style fried fish tacos take that street food to a new level. One of these days, I'll save up my pesos and go for the prix fixe at the counter.

    "text": "The internet steered us to Holbox and wow I am glad that it did! Located in a nondescript food court/mall, Chef Gilbert Centina and his team serve elevated Mexican seafood. I've eaten excellent food in Mexico City and this is comparable in quality to the best I tried over there. This restaurant could easily be located in a fancy venue with significantly more expensive prices, so it's to the great fortune of Los Angeles (and tourists like myself) that it isn't.\n\nWe had the kanpachi (smoked fish) and uni tostada, baja fish and pulpo en su tinta (octopus in calamari ink sofrito) tacos, and ceviche (catch of the day — we had tuna). The seafood was all incredibly fresh and delectable. I'm not a fan of octopus but I knew that Holbox makes a good one, and sure enough it had the light flakiness of a delicate fish. There was no \"fishy\" flavour and the sauces were thoughtful and complemented the meat well (I particularly enjoyed the ink sauce that accompanied the octopus taco).\n\nThe table also has five different hot sauces, which are fun to eat with the chips and salsa served before the meal.\n\nWe arrived ten minutes before opening and didn't need to wait in line. There was consistently a line the entire time we were there, but it seemed to be moving quickly.\n\nOne last thing: shout out to the Oaxacan place across the aisle in the food court that makes an awesome cafe de olla!

    "text": "It’s located inside of a building where many restaurants combined together just like a regular food court .  Food is upscale based on Mexican seafood cuisine and made everything nicely done and touched with different colors and ingredients.  I think they were or are in Bib Gourmand and one of few restaurants that’s on Michelin Guide book which is I think mainly focus on food because you can sit anywhere in the building, many people walk in and out, eat different food from other restaurants and it doesn’t have nice interior like comfy chairs and table.  However; they understand how important to serve the seafood with freshness and they don’t kill ingredients with many different sauces!  All the sauces and ingredients are speaking individually and I don’t know why everything matches perfectly.  This amazing seafood restaurant is definitely my recommendation.

The presentation at Holbox is among the best I’ve ever seen. The uni kampachi tostada was one of the best bites of food I’ve had this year. I also recommend all of the tacos (especially the fried ones) and the prawn and scallop aguachile—best sauce ever.\n\nHolbox is a must-try. Just plan ahead a bit and you’ll have a great time there.
