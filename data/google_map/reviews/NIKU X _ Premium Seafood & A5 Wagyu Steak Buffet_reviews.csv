Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT210eWF6SlFOakp5VVVOT2IxUmhVRmhuYTFoRU4yYxAB,Jennifer Y.,1 star,2025-11-17,"Over rated, over priced, and such a huge disappointing. This was supposed to be the highlight of our trip to LA. Instead it became the worst part of it.
We sat at a table without a grill - meaning our food was to be prepped by a chef and delivered to us instead of us cooking it ourselves (Korean bbq style). What I thought this meant was the food would be prepped to perfection and our service would be a lot better since the price difference was $50 per person. Instead we got cooked meat delivered to us cold, the slowest service I have ever seen at any restaurant, and pretty much the worst experience I have had in a very very long time. Every single time we ordered meat it came to our table cold. But because wagyu is so high in fat, the fat didn’t “melt in our mouth” it felt like we were chewing sticks of butter/lard. Dish after dish came this way. I was nearly about to lose my mind until we finally decided that we were both just done and ready to leave. That made me feel a lot better to just give up on the experience and decide to escape the place entirely.  The manager came by and asked if we were doing ok but it was only by the time we were about to ask for our check after the entire horrendous experience and leave. So he was too late. Nothing really happened after he heard about our experience. He said sorry and that he hoped he could make it right but we only had one more serving of meat left from our earlier order so there was really nothing he could have done except maybe make sure the last two tiny portions of meat don’t come out stone cold.
Their buffet food was very low quality, the service was super slow, and the price was really too high for what you get.
Anyways, I highly recommend skipping this place and I’m really not sure how they have such high ratings. They do seem to have a strong social media presence. Maybe that has something to do with it. Please just beware and don’t get disappointed like we did! Food: 1 Service: 1 Atmosphere: 4

Sounds limited, especially since you're doing the cooking, but you'll be stuffed within the first hour. Everything was superb, can you believe this is an AYCE Wagyu restaurant!

You ruined my birthday, a party of 12, by losing aka “never receiving” my reservation. I made the reservation a week and a half before. We spoke twice over the phone about the menu, how I would receive a call 24 hours before the reservation, menu options, how I would need to choose a specific menu so that we could be sat cohesively together, my number, email… there is no excuse. My friend wrote a review on how poorly handled the conversation went hours before our arrival when we called to see what was going on. You told him you would follow up, even made us send you evidence of our calls which is really quite embarrassing not only on treatment on our part as a special occasion, but also on the lack of professionalism on your part on what is supposed to be a fine dining establishment. It is clear you are nothing of a sort as you never even contacted me and I am here to let the charade you put on that you take care of your customers post terrible experiences is false. You ruined my birthday, and now you are ruining your own reputation. I will be contacting the Better Business Bureau as well as the local media for how terribly this was handled.

We paid $655 + tip for a meal for family of four that I will remember as a waste of money. The food was all cheap quality and unsatisfactory. If you are truly a foodie, this place is not for you. Food is bland and flavorless. Best way to describe it you meet a woman on dating app she is very photogenic and you have great conversations over the phone, so you plan this amazing date but when you see her in real life the pictures dont match and the in person communication is dull and boring.

What would elevate them to a luxurious high-end Japanese restaurant rather a regular Japanese bbq buffet that offers wagyu would be if their meats were cut thicker, even if they were the same ounce. Small or even limited portions would be fair at such a deal, but sacrificing quality of the meats potential doesn’t feel right. The in-between awkwardly thin meats make it impossible to have a pink center. The meat will always be either over cooked or appear boiled. If ur going to have wagyu, gotta do it right!
Other than that, the service is amazing and the other bites prepared to order are amazing, especially the seabass wrap! Food: 3 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 4

I picked 2 $149 options, I couldn’t justify it if it wasn’t my birthday haha, the food was very good. The service was great, the portions per serving were a little small but reasonable for unlimited style. You’re able to pick two cuts of meat at a time and as many sides as you want, I filled my table to the brim with food to make my moneys worth. But I still feel like I only got 80% of my value back, they did not slow me down but the cut off time did catch up to me.

They have a cut off for cooked dishes from the kitchen 1 and a half hours into your 2 hour time. It’s odd but not unreasonable, I was given a a drink for free which was nice. I can say I would go again but I would choose the $109 buffet seating rather than the steak house seating.

We made a reservation two weeks ago, and the staff confirmed it multiple times, they took down our name, phone number, and email, and assured us that our reservation was confirmed.

When we called today to reconfirm, we were told that there was no record of our reservation. To make matters worse, the manager we spoke with was very unhelpful and unwilling to provide any appropriate support or solution.

This level of disorganization and lack of customer care is unacceptable for a restaurant of this caliber. We had planned our evening around this reservation and were left extremely disappointed. I hope management takes this feedback seriously and improves both their reservation system and customer service going forward. Service: 1

We made a reservation at Niku X weeks in advance for a party of 12 to celebrate a dear friend’s birthday. On the day of the event, the restaurant claimed they had no record of our reservation. This was incredibly upsetting, especially since this was meant to be a special night.

To make matters worse, the manager was very unprofessional and rude when we tried to resolve the issue. Instead of helping us or showing any empathy, they dismissed our concerns entirely. We had to scramble last minute to find another place for our group, which completely ruined the celebration.

I would not recommend Niku X to anyone planning an important occasion. A restaurant of this caliber should know how to manage reservations and treat guests with respect.",[]

At one point, we were served some meat we didn’t recognize, so we asked him how we were supposed to eat it. Instead of answering politely, he roughly threw the meat on the grill with his tongs, dipped it forcefully into the sauce in front of me, and then tossed it onto my plate. When I looked at his face, his arrogant and condescending attitude absolutely shocked me.

Being busy is no excuse for showing such disrespect. His fake polite tone couldn’t hide his cold, dismissive attitude and the clear irritation on his face. It was honestly insulting. This restaurant tries to act high class, but with a server like him, the entire place loses its credibility. One employee like that can completely ruin the atmosphere and my experience here was absolutely ruined because of him. Food: 1 Service: 1 Atmosphere: 1

The all you can eat was self-serve and not cooked for us. For the absurd price of the dinner, this is quite frankly ridiculous. We had to walk halfway across the restaurant to get the wagyu, bring it back, and cook it.

Perfect service (they actually carried in a bench seat for us because the chairs were too narrow) all the food was amazing! But I highly suggest the Chilean Sea Bass wraps! Life changing!!! The sashimi was THE best I've had in SoCal.  We loved that they had warm butter on tap (I would have preferred it to not be garlic butter) The steaks absolutely ruined me for all future steaks! Melt in your mouth doesn't do it justice.  I expected to focus on the lobster tail but to be honest, I was a little disappointed in them. I tried 3 different tails and none of them were easy to remove from the shell even though they were all cut down the back. The flavor was good however and they were nice sized. The star of the night was by far the Chilean Sea Bass!!! Do not skip it! We paid $119 each plus $16 for valet parking (loved that option) and we considered it completely worth every penny. Even if its only a once in a lifetime visit, you should definitely go!

Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2xWV1EzWkZTbUpUUTNOaGEwMXdYM2RTU1RBelgzYxAB,Linda Nguyen,5 stars,2025-10-20,"The restaurant is located inside the Intercontinental Hotel on the 2nd floor. You can park in the garage or valet and they will validate 2.5 hours. We got seated right away with reservations for a friend's birthday and service was extraordinary.There's two weekend dinner options: regular $119/$109 for Chubby plus members)or $159/$149(members).

Buffet: fruits, seaweed and octopus salad, ceviche, raw veggies to grill, regular salad and sauces.
Sushi: crudo of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, tartare and unagi don.
Meat display: brisket and chef's choice.

Hot Seafood: King crab and snow crab served hot not cold like other buffets.  They used to have lobster tails accessible, but you now order with your server and it came out hot, precut for easy peeling, and so plump, juicy, and sweet! Also, even though our reservation was at 5:30PM,  they had ran out of hot seafood at 5:45PM. Instead of refilling it, they said they will refill it at 6PM. So expect to come back.  They refilled it around 6PM and everything was cooked perfectly;  not overcooked or dry. Both types of crab legs were sweet, juicy, and slightly salty. Perhaps because it is not the season, the King crab legs were sadly skinny.
Raw Bar: scallops, shrimp, prawns and mussels with their respective sauces and sushi rolls.

Order with Server:
Appetizers: potato tarrine: flaky layers of deep fried potato.
Oxtail potsticker: juicy and flavorful.
Miso Chilean seabass on a lettuce cup: our favorite but the miso glaze was a bit too sweet for us.
Wagyu curry: texture of slightly crunchy carrots, tender wagyu beef over rice is just so comforting and hearty.
The men really loved shitshito peppers
Other apps: deep fried broccoli, miso corn, wagyu pepper beef, chicken wings, waffle fries which is basic.

Soups: tom yum is good for those who like the kick of spice and hint of coconut.
Miso soup: Ironically, it didn't taste like miso soup, it was more like light dashi soup with mushrooms, tofu and seaweed.
Desserts: egg tarts are a must if you want crispy, flakey, and crunchy layers of crust with just enough egg custard.
Another favorite was the mille crepe with chocolate cream, but was informed tonight, it is not offered anymore.
Hazelnut cake: not too sweet and soft.
Other desserts: earl Grey and vanilla cake roll was okay. They don't make some of the desserts and instead choose to serve those packaged cakes you get from the Asian grocery store. The dessert option doesn’t align with the premium exclusive experience they're aiming for.

Meats: sticking to the basic menu is just as satisfying especially if you enjoy the thinner slices of brisket and beef tongue. If you really want to try the thicker cuts of premium meats, then choose the premium menu. Sadly, our favorite, the aged tomahawk which has to be reserved 24 hours in advance was removed from their menu so it is no longer an option.
Drinks: yuzu sparkler and peach slush.
Refreshing and so good after a salty and fatty meal. No comment, I can probably down a gallon of it.

And lastly, Joe ,our server, was so friendly and fun. He made wonderful recommendations and was responsive to all of our requests. He made everything so fast and easy by having the bill and parking validation ready before we even had to ask about it. He even threw in special little touches like a grilled lobster tail option that is not on the menu, and made everyone have an amazing dinner experience. Do note, the grilled lobster tail was very salty, so you can ask them to be a little less heavy handed in the seasoning if possible.

Overall, this is a great place to celebrate a special occasion like birthdays or anniversaries for unlimited seafood and specialty meats like A5 wagyu.  They do stritctly enforce the 90 min so I would avoid bringing babies or young children, those who don't eat and or picky eaters if possible as you may spend most of your time catering to them. If you can't, you have to be really strategic to maximize your time and pocket.

We had a reservation and arrived about ten minutes late, but the staff was kind enough to seat us right away and were very accommodating at first. Unfortunately, the restaurant seemed pretty understaffed that night, which made it difficult to get our waiter’s attention when we needed anything.

The main attraction here is supposed to be the high-quality meats, but honestly, most of what we were served tasted very similar, and none of it came close to the quality you’d get at a high-end steakhouse like Baltaire. For a restaurant charging $150 per person, the experience just didn’t justify the price. The buffet was also limited and felt underwhelming.

The biggest issue, though, came afterward. The shrimp we tried tasted off, and a few hours later both of us became violently ill, with nonstop vomiting and painful stomach issues that lasted through the night. When we called the restaurant to let them know, the only response we received was, “I’m sorry that happened.” There was no effort to follow up, investigate, or offer any form of assistance or compensation.

Darren was so attentive, helpful, and friendly. We didn't have to look around for him to place our orders or ask questions. I loved his friendly and approachable smile. In addition to Darren, there was one other gentleman that helped us a lot, I neglected to obtain his name. Our water glass and drinks were never empty, table was never overcrowded with plates, and our grill was changed multiple times just in time.

The food was excellent. The seafood, sushi, meats, special dishes, and dessert were so fresh. The portion were also the perfect sizes. It was our sons first time. They loved it and we plan to go back for another birthday celebration. Can't even rank the food, since they were all so good!

So glad we saved dessert for last. The egg tarts were amazing. I want more!

Wagyu was a proper A5 grade. 10/10
Service was good, a bit slow and messed up the orders few times but overall was a great experience.
What I didnt like was that despite having a reservation at 8:00 PM, and arriving 10 minutes before, they kept us waiting until 8:10PM.

We were never offered dessert, instead got a little slushie cup for my birthday. For the experience, I would recommend if you’re willing to consume seafood and raw sushi, otherwise it’s not worth it just for the wagyu steaks.

Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT2t3d2NuVnZTVkF4Y1doRGMwTjZSekI2ZW5kVFkyYxAB,Stan Dela Cruz,3 stars,a month ago,"I recently went to NIKU X Los Angeles, which is on the 2nd floor of the Intercontinental Hotel.

The place has a beautiful ambience—clean, classy, and perfect for a nice night out.
They offer valet parking and validate for 2.5 hours, but since we had three cars, we still ended up paying almost $100 extra after the free hours. For just over an hour of staying—dining, picture-taking, and exploring the hotel—it felt a bit pricey just for parking.

When it comes to the food, they have two options: $109 per person and $149 per person.

The $109 already includes unlimited lobster, seafood, beef, sushi, sashimi, and more from the buffet.
The $149 option is marketed as the “premium experience,” with unlimited Japanese A5 Wagyu and a few other special dishes.

We decided to go for the $149 option for the experience.
The unlimited Wagyu sounds great, but to be honest, it was underwhelming.
If you’ve had authentic Japanese A5 Wagyu before, you’d know the taste and quality are usually outstanding even without seasoning.
But here, it just didn’t have that same melt-in-your-mouth flavor.

For me, it felt overpriced and not really worth the hype.
Meanwhile, the “special seafood” at $149—like king crab legs, shrimp with caviar, and a few other items—are only served once, not unlimited.

The best part of the evening was actually the ambience and the service.
Our server Naomi was amazing—friendly, attentive, and she explained everything so clearly.
She really made my birthday celebration special.

Overall, if you’re a seafood lover, I’d say just go with the $109 option.
You already get plenty—lobster, shrimp, sushi, sashimi, and more—without spending extra on Wagyu that doesn’t really stand out.

The $149 feels too expensive for what it offers. The place is definitely beautiful, the service is excellent, but next time I’d probably just stick with the $109—or maybe try another spot.

Ambiance & Service (4.5/5): The restaurant sits a few floors up, and our dinner with another couple started off smoothly—we were seated immediately with a reservation at a window table overlooking the street. The layout is thoughtfully arranged with enough space for movement and wheelchair access. It can host everything from small parties to large groups (we saw a table of ~20). The ambiance is upscale, modern, and lively, though the bathrooms felt underwhelming—small, limited stalls, and the trash was overflowing.
Service overall was attentive. Our waiter was friendly, offered great recommendations, and staff were quick to help when we accidentally spilled a drink—cleaning it up professionally and replacing it without question. Plenty of servers and even managers circulate the floor to assist. At this price point, I would have expected the premium cuts to be cooked table-side by staff rather than us, but that’s more of a missed opportunity than a dealbreaker.

Food: The wagyu was solid—hard to get wrong, and I’d give it a 4.5/5 so long as cuts aren’t too thick or thin. Seafood, however, was mixed. The carpaccio was fresh and flavorful, but the king crab legs were small, dry, and more effort than reward. Bibs would have been a thoughtful touch given the mess factor. The snow crab legs, on the other hand, were the highlight of the night—we kept going back for more. Still, the overall spread left me wanting more variety, particularly in veggies, fruit, and dessert. At this price, I’d expect at least a fruit bar and a stronger dessert selection.

Overall: Niku X delivers a refined dining experience with polished service and a strong ambiance, but at $150 a head, I expected a bit more across the board—especially on seafood variety and premium touches like tableside grilling. Worth a visit for the snow crab legs and the wagyu, but not quite the fully extravagant experience I anticipated.

Despite the The food is excellent—premium Wagyu like Toriyama and delicious crab—and the staff is kind, Unfortunately, the overall experience doesn’t justify the price.
The ambience is too crowded, with dirty floors and utensils, and buffet trays often sit empty too long. I’ve ordered a bottle of water and then the staff refilled my glass with water from the jar without noticing that I have a bottle , and the serrated knives provided aren’t fit for cutting fine Wagyu. For $250, you can enjoy a far better dinner in a refined setting. I honestly don’t understand why this place was so full.

It seems like cubby cattle collaborates with Niku to tap into high end dinning but haven't figured out the branding and execution of a high end Ayce experience.

Beef quality is premium. Crabs and lobsters are overcooked like you won't believe. Literally felt like biting my own finger when biting on the big head shrimp. However they don't gate keep their good stuff. All the seafood and waygu are at the buffet station. Love the no fuss buffet.

Buffet station is small and make-shift from a bar/hallway. some of the beef and most of the ""filler"" type side dishes has to be ordered from the servers. It is confusing what needs to be ordered what's not, so we ended up didn't order much but just focused on the seafood and waygu at the buffet, which is good for us bad for their business lol. Types of sushi selection comes and goes at the buffet which is odd.

Guest has no dress code. We dressed up but saw flipflops lol. Overall it feels more like a chubby cattle resturant than Niku.

Our server Nate is nice. We got a small dessert for our Anniversary celebration. Food: 4 Service: 4 Atmosphere: 4 Reservation Reservations recommended Noise level Loud, but you can still talk Wait time No wait Parking space Plenty of parking Parking options Valet

1. The buffett section lacks variety
2. Even though they show closing at 11, we got informed by our server of last call to order food around 9:30 (we stat down around 8:35, so well before our 2 hour time limit). This left a bad impression, as my wife needed to feed the son as well, so she eats slower and left the place still hungry. At $145 usd a person, plus tax and tips, i would expect they either tell us as soon as we arrive.

Dinner was a $150 buffet per person. Basically, everything was delicious. However, there were a few things that bothered me. The buffet section had a limited selection of food, which was disappointing. Having to grab a staff member to order was a bit of a hassle for a buffet. They grilled the meat for us, but the sauces were so limited that we quickly got bored. We had to eat it almost entirely with salt. The quality of the staff wasn't that great. It's not something I'd want to return to. The atmosphere in the restaurant was very nice.

A few things in random order:

1.) Location is great and so is the decor.
2.) We were seated promptly (a Thursday).  Party of 6 but they don't really have any rectangular tables so we sat in 1 square and 1 circular table so we could all fit.  That was odd and annoying.
3.)  Service is slow.   The place was not busy but the server would disappear for awhile.  I know it's a buffet but restaurants make $$ on drinks moreso than anything else.
4.) The drinks were....meh.   I was looking for a fancy old fashion or mule.  Instead the drink menu had 6 or 7 l drinks and it seemed all pre-made and some slushy style with alcohol.  (Felt cheap) Not a fancy menu at all for the top dollar being spent.  The wine was good but came in a bottle (lol)
5.) Seafood options - Lobster, Tiger/large shrimp, sushi.  These options were good - however - I would go elsewhere and eat that as a separate meal.
6.) The Tomahawk was ok.   We ordered 1 per couple.  It was too much because that should've been a separate meal as well.  Instead of eating buffet/unlimited seafood and a big tomahawk.   It would've been better to eat twice there at a more modest price.  (That was our bad)
7.) The Tomahawk ""show"" to wow us.  Meh... maybe because I got older and it was a repeat of a past experience.  We had 3 Tomahawks and got 1 show.   We had to share the first Tomahawk because they didn't bring us the other 2 until 30 mins later.   Again restaurant was not busy at all.
8.) The bill.  The bill came and certain items that were comped because of the birthday were not.  They were charged. Also, when they fixed it they taxed us on the FULL amount vs the subtotal.  Their excuse was that the item was ""prepared"" so it's still taxable.  Lastly on the bill.  The tip was automatically included on again the full amount including the items comped.   So where they comped???  It all was corrected after their frustration.  Table was full of numbers people so.....yeah.  Saved $30 per person...worth it.

Overall, the spot is nice and the food ok for the price point and experience.

Go once and say you went.

If you go don't do the Tomahawk.  Get at the A5 if you can and balance that with the seafood.

Some folks question the legitimacy of the wagyu quality.   I'm not a connoisseur but will say that I'll stick to my ribeye and the smaller cuts of Wagyu. Food: 3 Service: 2 Atmosphere: 4

I have recommended to so many friends and family members for their special occasions as well. Last night my wife and I celebrated our anniversary and left extremely disappointed. The service and staff were friendly and attentive and our server Emily was great. However, the new buffet style ruins the atmosphere that once was and the experience is just not the same. We ordered the tomahawk tasting menu and requested our steak medium-rare. When it came out and the server sliced it the inside was cold and the steak was practically purple. We are not the type to send something back, but we swallowed our embarrassment and notified the server. Both the server and manager were both extremely apologetic and agreed that the steak should have not been sent out like that. We were told we would get a new steak, but instead the same sliced steak was just put back on the grill so each piece became tough and chewy and lacked flavor. Not what you would expect when you pay $300+ for a steak and $450 for a meal. Unfortunately we don’t plan to be back and will no longer be recommending this restaurant to our friends and family.

The $149 all-you-can-eat A5 Wagyu beef experience at Niku is absolutely worth it. This isn’t just dinner—it’s a culinary event. The cheaper tier lets you cook the meat yourself, but I wouldn’t recommend that—especially if you’re like me and don’t even enjoy cooking at home. Ruining such delicate, premium beef would feel like a crime.

There’s a wide range of offerings beyond beef—seafood, sushi, sashimi, caviar, lobster, and more. But trust me:

Come hungry.
Start with the A5 Wagyu beef—don’t get distracted by other dishes too early.
Stick firmly to your preferred doneness, even if the waiter suggests otherwise.
After trying at least two A5 Wagyu cuts, then go all out on everything else.

Their miso soup is rich and comforting, and the other beef cuts are also delicious. The desserts, though? Honestly, underwhelming—bland and forgettable.

Service has been consistently excellent on all my visits. Book well in advance—this is a rare dining experience. They claim to be the only one of its kind in the country, and I believe it—I haven’t seen anything like this elsewhere.

- great meat selection and some tasty cooked items on the menu (like seabass with lettuce)
- decent seating arrangement; not too crowded, smoky or smelly

Cons
- seafood buffet selection is limited and taste med; no fresh vegetables of any kind (I wanted some lettuce wraps for my grilled meat)
- it’s either busy on a Friday night or there is a shortage of staff as it’s hard to place orders since servers are always occupied and nowhere to be found
- dessert is lowkey sad, limited to some cheesecake only and looks premade and purchased
- price is steep, can’t justify the food, I would recommend any good kbbq joint in ktown. Food: 3 Service: 3 Atmosphere: 4 Reservation Reservations recommended Noise level Moderate noise Seating type Indoor dining area

We went with the premium option since it was our first visit and we wanted to try everything. The food was good and there were a lot of selections.

That said, the experience wasn’t as enjoyable as we hoped. The server didn’t explain anything or walk us through the menu. I even mentioned that it was our first time, but we were still left totally confused about how it all worked. Instead of helping or offering any recommendations, he just kept pushing the potstickers and asked if we wanted rice because it would “go well” with what we already had. Since he kept suggesting the potstickers, we figured we’d give them a try—but they never even came.

I ordered the Yakisuki thinking it’d be something cool to try, but it didn’t come with the egg yolk dip, which made it feel incomplete. Honestly, the whole experience felt like if you didn’t already know what to order, too bad—the server wasn’t going to guide you.

After the meal, I did some research and realized I missed out on a bunch of items I would’ve liked to try. Overall, the experience felt overrated, and I wish I had spent that $400 somewhere else.

The entire setup of the restaurant is definitely not suitable for a get up and grab your own food style buffet and the selection to grab is also very limited. It was honestly a weird experience since the menu itself is actually pretty standard in size, but the presentation and idea to get up to grab the food from the serving area was awkward.

You would have to wait for a refresh of new food to grab, and given that the restaurant had a decent size, felt somewhat awkward when there wasn't any food left, or very few left to grab.

Some of the appetizers were pretty good, but others were really surprisingly lackluster. The ceviche that is always offered has a very bland flavor, it felt like it was missing some core flavor profiles.

For the price of $100+ before tax and tip, I honestly felt like I could've went anywhere else for this price and had a more positive memorable meal.

Very knowledgeable about the menu, both food and drinks and continued to help us pick great options. Daniel (I believe Im remembering his name right) at the host stand was also really nice and very accommodating when our table was taking longer to be ready than our reservation time.

We got the premium menu (priced at $159 pp; recently increased and not properly reflected on their whole website and certain physical menus) which included the seafood buffet and all of the steak cuts.  The steaks were all delicious, from the domestic Wagyu to the delicious JP A5, and the self serve seafood buffet was full enough that everyone could find something to enjoy. They also had restock times for some of the more popular items as well as utensils like seafood scissors and crab crackers which were necessities.

I’d definitely take some time to consider what you’re going to want to get and when—like getting a buffet plate and enjoying what you got first before ordering some steak—so you don’t let certain foods get cold or cross flavors you may not have intended to, which was a slight issue I had figured may (and did) happen, but that didn’t take away from the food quality.

Great overall experience from the whole staff. I’d go again simply to enjoy the experience differently, maybe at one of the KBBQ style table grills or just ordering my dinner differently, but if you’re thinking about giving it a go and/or concerned about the price point, I’d say it’s worth your while at least once to see and judge for yourself !

While the restaurant definitely looks upscale and visually impressive, the experience unfortunately didn’t live up to expectations.

Service was a major letdown. It felt like we were lucky just to get our waiter’s attention during the entire meal. For a place that presents itself as fine dining, the level of attention and hospitality was severely lacking.

As for the food, the meats were just okay—nothing special or memorable. The buffet selection was very limited, especially considering the high price point. What’s worse is that the lunch menu doesn’t offer the variety or quality you’d expect compared to dinner, yet it’s still expensive.

For what we paid, I expected top-tier meats and exceptional service. Instead, we left feeling disappointed and like the whole experience was overpriced for what little was offered. I wouldn’t recommend coming here for lunch, especially if you’re expecting the kind of selection and service that should come with a premium price tag.

The A5 Wagyu is the undisputed highlight—expertly grilled tableside, incredibly tender, and full of rich flavor. We’re also big fans of the shrimp and lobster tails—always fresh and satisfying. Don’t miss the Miso Chilean Seabass wrap (ordered separately)—a buttery, melt-in-your-mouth bite that’s absolutely worth it.

We first met Cody at the Little Tokyo Chubby Cattle location and were happy to see him here. He always makes us feel welcome—like a friend ensuring we enjoy every aspect of the meal. Wilson was our main server and was fantastic throughout—attentive, professional, and warm.

One note: premium seafood items like king crab and lobster tails are replenished on a schedule. At this price point, continuous availability would be more fitting. Also, pre-shelled lobster tail would improve the overall dining ease.

We’ve been Chubby Club members for a few months now, and it’s a great value for those who dine here often. Valet parking with validation is currently $24 (up from $16.50 nine months ago), still reasonable considering the regular $54 rate without validation.

Reservations are highly recommended—use OpenTable to secure a spot. The dining experience is limited to 120 minutes, so plan accordingly.

Exceptional food, top-tier service, and a sleek, modern ambiance make Niku X a must-try. We’ll absolutely be back.

I visited Niku X and have no complaints about the service. The staff were very friendly, cleaned our table promptly, and frequently checked if everything was okay. However, the food was a major letdown. It wasn’t terrible, but it was far from good. The meat was overly fatty (not same as wagyu that we had in Japan), and the crab was excessively salty, almost as if it was intentionally overseasoned to discourage eating too much.
Initially, I thought $149 was reasonable for high-quality meat, crab, and lobster, but we ended up with portions that felt worth only about $30. Even as someone who doesn’t eat large portions, I couldn’t enjoy more than a few bites. I’m writing this review to save others time and money. You’re better off dining somewhere else with better quality food and portions that are satisfying, especially if you’re not a big eater.

There were several options for an All You Can Drink to go along with your meal which includes soft  drinks, beers and soju for $20. But honestly how much can you drink with the great selection of options to eat.  All of the meats were good. They came in 5oz and 3oz portions.  Cooked to order.    But you would expect so for $150 per head.  The side options were good.  The seafood was a great accompaniment and for some reason the chilled fruits helped contrast the fatty meats between bites.  The only think I would change if we went next time would be to select the self bbq option.  It was an issue that the smaller meat portions  cooked to order were served on large cold plates.  So when they get to you the wagyu is already on the cold side.  They should have preheated the plates or served on something that was less heat conducting.  Still a good evening but expensive!

The service was excellent both times, we didn’t catch our servers name the first time, but today it was Nessie. Absolutely love the food, the atmosphere, and the service. Another success from the chubby group :) . I’m obsessed!!! We made reservations both times , not sure how walk ins are like but I still highly recommend making a reservation ahead of time it does seem to get pretty busy. For the parking garage, I think you can self park sometimes but we valet both times. First time parking was full and they said valet only, second time, we just went straight to valet and the staff did mention it was also valet only . You get a 2 hour validation from the restaurant so parking will be $16.50 :) . Even the parking staff were immaculate. My boyfriend and I both had bad experiences with valet but service here in this building is superb :) . 10/10 experience all around !

We had the $159/person menu Without Grill on table  although the menu we got as well as the web clearly says $149/person( kind of misleading). First round we tried the JP A5 Ribeyes and Striploin which both melts in your mouth with an aroma that is indeed A grade JP Wagyu beef. We also grab some crab legs from the station and crab meat is warm and fresh. Everything seems to be good for the first 30 minutes and then things went south. It took them 30 minutes to get the 2nd round of the Wagyu steak from the kitchen AFTER we complained to the waiter for wait 20 minutes for nothing. Although the waiter and the manager did manage to get the steak speed up later on, even offering free drinks, we ended up with lots of Wagyu steaks on the table at the same time and it soon became too overwhelming while eating too much oily steak for such a short period of time. Till the end, we realized that we never even get the lobster tail we ordered earlier while they will never forget your appetizers. As for the dessert, they have a limited selection of cake flavors. Make sure you order the ones you like in between the dining otherwise you might not be able to get the flavor you want at the end. Overall, crab labs are good, shrimp is okay,  sashimi is average but at least they all taste fresh. A5 Wagyu only the Premium 5 oz Wagyu Worth the try but not the special Wagyu cut. If you like seafood, just go with the basic menu option. If you want Wagyu, make sure you reserve the table WITH GRILL or you will get GRILLED. By the way, for the owner, you need to update your website about the pricing otherwise it is misleading for the table with or without a grill.

Our server Joe C made this such a wonderful experience. we went with the premium selection and it’s beyond worth the upcharge. The quality is night and day from what is available at the buffet (although the buffet is very worth it as well!).

There was only a line at 8:45 for the buffet but besides that was able to walk up and grab whatever in seconds. The sashimi was high quality and the cocktail shrimp were delicious! The king crab was (obviously) not as high quality as you’d find from a la carte king crab, but this was expected and was still very good.

The seabass, a5 ribeye and strip loin were the table favorites. desert was skippable. overall a fantastic meal and worth the cost Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Price per person $100+ Food: 5 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 5

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURvallfRGZ3EAE,Art Lam,1 star,2025-05-01,"For a luxury restaurant, it's not just about the food but the whole dining experience. Here are the details:
Reservations for the Chubby insiders (Gold
NFT), who has priority reservations privileges: me.
1 star At reservation via Discord community concierge, it didn't require me to select tomahawk dinner or buffet dinner. I thought it is a decision at dine-in time. OpenTables reservation does request/require the decision (kudos!) This resulted in not getting the meal I made the restaurant reservation for. Mission unaccomplished! Zero (0) stars
Made the reservation at 6:30pm but not at my requested time: 7:30pm. 1 star
Management review 2 stars
The manager came to explain that reservation is required to order the tomahawk meal and there must be an issue with the corporate priority reservation system. I commend the Manager's patience to explain that it takes 3 hours to prepare the tomahawk and so requires the reservation. I told him that I drove 500 miles to dine there and see if he can help find a solution. He was patient but can't offer any solutions. Sigh... He did ask if there is anything he can do to make my stay more pleasant, please let him know. Hmmm... although sincere, but no real solution and no hard offers. Hey, a $5 discount coupon or some concession of something can ease my displeasure of the establishment (whether it is corporate or the operator that made the mistake for my predicament of not getting the meal I intended to have). Another solution is to start cooking another tomahawk at 6:30pm for the 9:30 client and provide the spare for me.
They close at midnight. Hey, I'm not manager to offer solutions. I felt he could have done better.
Decor (decoration) is nice but the environment feels like a flea market... as an upscale restaurant with $100-$250 meal tickets, something can be done to make it more comfy.
More comments if inquired.

Feedback at Discord: zero stars
I thought that I would provide this feedback internally to the company via their chat community. ""Aiyu Jelly"" handle name which is a trusted friend of the company responded by implying that i didn't read the menu. The fine print is embedded in the menu of 8x11 with a small print. Check it out. I'll bet you can't find it.
Then, some of my comments similar to this here are censored (deleted) in the feedback section! I don't know if the same person or other company person did the censoring. Why ask for feedback when censoring? And I'm locked out for 24 hours in commenting. So, here I am.
As for the server Nate, excellent 5+ stars service. Patient in hearing my orders; gives great recommendations and offers different ways to enjoy my meal. Michelin Star service.
The company should give him bonuses!
Food & drinks: 3 stars summary
Since I didn't get my intended meal of sit down served meal of tomahawk plus seafood & appetizers. -2 stars

Fruity cocktail was offered & accepted. Excellent tastes with the lychee infused alcoholic drink.
(3.0 stars.)
Meat & seafood (3 stars)
A5 steaks... filet, rib eye, ny steak all excellent quality ... 4 stars rounded down to 3 stars. And I have to cook it myself on the grill. Grill fire is quite high and not adjustable, so it's hard to cook it correctly (-1 star). Nate (server) suggested that I let the kitchen cook it. It's better but still not the best. For the buffet review: the cooked seafood quality was 3 stars ... limited in variety and bland. Lobster tail was cold & I had to put in the grill to heat it up (2 stars). Perhaps some sauce can be provided besides hot butter? The sashimi of tuna, hamachi & salmon are pretty good. (3.5 stars).
Side dishes & appetizers & dessert & coffee shishito peppers very good with right sauce
4 stars
Seabass lettuce wrap... yummy but not can be tastier or wrapped better 3.5 stars
Oxtail pot stickers... meat inside is too dry.
Sauce was nice . 1 star

I requested my wagyu to be medium rare and it came out over cooked like beef jerky. This definitely made me question if they’re using a cheap meat vendor for their steaks to make a profit. On this Monday at 7pm, they’ve already ran out of half of the cocktail menu which was disappointing. The service, was awful. Overall it wasn’t busy that night, but it felt like the bigger tables had priority for service as I noticed others with a table of two kept looking around for their waiter as well. I chose the $149 buffet option, and you’re still limited on the amount of meats you can receive but once again, I stuck with the seafood option because of how low of quality the meat tasted. I go to high end restaurants all the time. This place is not high end. But the atmosphere is nice. Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Price per person $100+ Food: 1 Service: 1 Atmosphere: 1

Every bite of the food is scrumptious and savory. The best recommendation I can give is to not fill up on seafood...yes you get those delicious lobster tails, but you can honestly get that elsewhere. This place is better known for the beef, so get that!

Serice is great. They will go out of their way to make sure you know what you're getting.

They do have a timer on you sitting down, but it's not really that bad. By the time you get chose to 1 hr 30 minutes you're already going to be full or near full.

I have only on complaint, which probably won't apply to 70 to 80 percent of you. I wish the seats were a little more comfortable. I am a big dude with some funk in the trunk and I felt like my butt and legs were gonna break the chair. I wasn't gonna complain since it was my first visit.

As far as seating, the table arrangements are good enough that you won't hear your neighbor's conversation. It's loud enough in the entire restaurant that it should mask that. I did have to talk a little louder than normal to my other guest.

Overall, worth it to try the Wagyu!! Service Dine in Food: 5 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 4

Did the smart thing and avoided the easy carbs / dumplings / rice dishes in bulk and stuck to the protein (miso chilean sea bass, tons of wagyu orders). The ribeye was cut in a strangly thin way, so other cuts like the top sirloin, flank, etc were more enjoyable.

Turns out that wagyu is best consumed in smaller doses - learned that the hard way haha but will be back!

ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME ?

This was not the Premium Option, but we were sat late at 10 pm and we were told the chef’s order  from the kitchen would be closed in 15 minutes (90 minutes before closing time); therefore that destroyed the whole dinner.
If you are going to seat customers late; then you need to give them the same opportunity to get what the customers came there to get.
We came from DC and had looked forward to this experience and our party would not come back here again.
The lobsters were over cooked.
The king crab legs were so salty & dry.
We had to wait a long time for the sashimi to be refilled. (May be they had to catch the fish ???)
This restaurant would be out of business if it was in NYC.

The bad outweighs the goods and the bitterness of the poor service destroyed the experience.

Don’t seat your customers if you can’t provide great service & great food that you seem to promote. Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Price per person $100+ Food: 3 Service: 1 Atmosphere: 3 Recommended dishes Miso Chilean Sea Bass

They recently raised prices so it was $159 pp for the premium Ayce meal. Our server, Jerry, was fantastic. He explained everything to us and we enjoyed everything. I’d recommend sticking with the special menu items which you order from the server. The sashimi is fantastic. On the hot menu, we enjoyed the OC tail pot stickers and sea bass.

The unlimited A5 Wagyu and seafood buffet was impressive—lobster tails, king crab, sushi, and a solid rotation of grilled meats kept coming. But what made the night unforgettable was our server, Nicole. She brought such a lively and upbeat energy to our table. Her timing was spot-on, checking in just when we were ready for more without ever interrupting the flow. I’ve been to a lot of high-end spots, but few servers make as lasting an impression as she did! Service was exceptional!

She was attentive, fun, and had a great sense of humor. She knew exactly when to check in and offer another round before we lost momentum. As anyone who's done all-you-can-eat knows, those gaps between meats can slow you down, but Nicole made sure our grill time was seamless with no idle moments. I honestly wish there were a way to have Nicole as our server every time I visit—she made the entire experience ten times better!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNJenFTMlJREAE,Décio Campos,2 stars,2025-04-01,"This is a restaurant full of rules and quirks. You submit to the rules right on the reservation website, where you try to choose the menu you want to eat from, but the information is obscure and difficult to understand. Then, at the time of the meal, they try to put you on a more expensive menu, saying that it's for you... Enjoying the cheaper menu at $109.00 will require an extra hour's wait, and most customers are willing to pay the $158.00 menu, which is nothing special, just with fewer annoying rules for ordering dishes.
If you intend to eat wagyu beef, you can accept the higher price, but if you want seafood like King Crab and lobster, I don't recommend this place. They removed scallops and oysters from the menu, so it's not worth submitting to so many rules like time limits and restricted dishes, etc.
The King Crab is served cold, which makes it quite tasteless, while the Snow Crab is served hot and was very tasty.
It's nothing more than a restaurant with unfavorable cost-benefit!
Look for another place in Los Angeles that's like seafood, and you'll be much better served. Food: 2 Service: 2 Atmosphere: 2

No oysters and when i asked about them i was told that there was an oyster quarantine which i know now was a total lie...cafe sierra and many other places have them. No scallops... no lamb and the king crab was trash. They served the lowest quality I've ever seen.  Broken and small pieces dirty looking and mushy. The main reason we went was for the king crab. The chefs special waygu roll obviously sat for quite a while before it made it to the table and tasted weird. The big head prawns were rubbery and lacked flavor I've never had one before maybe that's how they are?

Now the good stuff.

The lobster tails were amazing. Tender sweet and juicy. They aren't in the buffet anymore but they are still unlimited and they bring them out really fast.  The oxtail dumplings were fire! The sashimi was extremely fresh and melted in your mouth. The snow crab was some of the best I've had.  Every single bite of beef was excellent! Their selection and quality is world class. The A5 ribeye was so good!
The best for last.... the miso seabass was so incredibly good!! It almost made up for the king crab. But it didn't and that's why i gave 3 stars.

In all the YouTube videos reviewing Niku x show giant king crab legs as long as your forearm,  but in reality they averaged 7 to 8 in. Moreover the circumference was maybe 3 in. The spiny points made it almost impossible to extract the meat! Scissors were so big and dull you couldn't cut them! With a 2 hr limit you can't ingest enough flesh too feel satisfied; punctured my fingers and lips! All you can eat lobster is now by ordering one to two at a time; time consuming. Couldn't get meat out of shell; it broke apart in fibers! They advertised oysters and scallops; ok right!
They've been removed from menu!
Crustaceans were salty and king crab dry.
$5 for 4 or 5 oz bottle of diet coke omg.
Server was nice ambiance nice; but dropped
$295 w/ parking and tip;  only thing good was beef; sea bass under cooked no smoky flavor. Bet you they'll never get me again shame on you niku x sham!",[]

""I want this"" ""are you sure?"" ""You know what it is right?"" Its like.. okay? Another member of my party was told ""you know this barley tea has caffeine right"", while hes drinking it, Then when we refused to pay 18-20% on a over 600$ bill, the waiter seemed to almost demand an explanation, and kept arguing with me. I understand he means well, but this environment of pretentiousness, talking down to customers, all while having barely maintained toilets, it all screams a very duck taped concept restaurant. The food quality was nowhere near the 160$ price tag. The poke at the buffet is actually the best part of the place.

Be aware that many dishes are not offered from the Youtube reviews you might have viewed. No special sashimi dish, sushi, sukiyaki, etc. The lobster tail  was small (more like crawfish)  and Costco had bigger, tastier king crab legs. The salad selection is very  limited and fast food quality. Crazy to spend ~ $1200 for six people for mediocre food and diner experience. Very disappointed with the overall selection and quality.

The food was incredible, especially the Tomahawk Ritual my wife ordered—it was extremely delicious. What made the evening truly special was being there with Lissette. We had a private table in the back, which added to the atmosphere.

Unfortunately, the buffet was smaller than I expected, and the service was lacking. Our server, James, was friendly and had a great smile, but he was rarely at our table. We often had to ask other staff to find him for us when we needed something. Given the cost of the experience, we expected better service and likely won't be returning. Nonetheless, it was a memorable night thanks to my wife.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTURRenRTVzd3RRAB,Joaquin Lanz,1 star,2025-03-01,"This restaurant was a major disappointment. I cannot believe that my parents and I spent $500 only to receive such poor service. On multiple occasions, I had to get up from the table because our server was nowhere to be found. We repeatedly asked for the table to be cleared, yet it remained cluttered throughout the meal. To make matters worse, the desserts were brought out while the table was still in the same state, as shown in the attached photo—further reflecting the lack of attention to service.

I chose the highest-tier buffet option, which is advertised as including premium Japanese beef cuts. However, the seafood selection was extremely underwhelming. The so-called King Crab was completely tasteless and appeared to have been frozen for a long time. As shown in the photos, the crab legs were unusually thin and lacked any substantial meat, making it clear that they had been stored frozen for an extended period. The same applies to the entire seafood bar.

Regarding the Japanese beef cuts, I have been to Japan over ten times and dined at no fewer than six reputable steak houses. Based on my experience, the beef served here was clearly frozen, and its quality was mediocre at best. While the restaurant claims to offer A5-grade meat, I find that highly unlikely. I have had A5 beef on numerous occasions, and while these cuts may indeed be Japanese, they do not meet the standards of true A5 quality.

The service was equally disappointing. Beyond the lack of attentiveness, the dessert—a simple Häagen-Dazs ice cream—was served in its original packaging with plastic spoons, showing a complete disregard for presentation. This level of service and quality might be acceptable at a $30-per-person establishment, but certainly not at a restaurant charging over $150 per person.

I hope this review helps others make an informed decision and avoid an experience that falls far short of expectations. Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Price per person $100+ Food: 1 Service: 1 Atmosphere: 1

The bartender who is also my server wasn't attentive at all.  I had to flag her down for everything, even when the busboy took away my utensils while I was away at the bathroom while the next round of lobster were coming.  I waited for a several minutes to see she would notice me with food in front of me without utensils but she did not so I had to tell her.   At a restaurant of this caliber, I expected servers to notice these things and take care of it before my prompting.  It wasn't like the bar area was busy.  And the lobsters weren't that good, either.  I could have bought them from the market and cooked better tasting lobsters at home.  Then when the check came, I noticed that she added to the bill for a sparkling water that I did not order and did not get so I had it removed before paying.   I was hoping that this place would be a good alternatige to Cafe Sierra,  but they fell way short.. Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Price per person $100+ Food: 3 Service: 1 Atmosphere: 4

Every time steak and other items came out they explained what it was and how it was prepared. Overall it was fantastic. For parking it was valet and it was about $17

One thing that did confuse us when booking our table was the “Steak Section” vs the “BBQ Buffet” section. The BBQ Buffet section is a table with a grill in the center whereas the Steak section didnt have a grill in the center. We preferred the steak section because they cooked the meat for you and you had a beautiful view of the city. Both have access to the buffet and unlimited items depending on which menu you picked.

The food is decent.  The best service I received was from the busser.  Not worth the hype, stay away. Service Dine in Price per person $100+ Food: 3 Service: 1 Atmosphere: 1

I recommend the sushi, and the meat is all delicious, so I think I can eat a lot, but I might get tired of it faster than I thought ㅎㅎ
It's clean and nice because it's inside the Intercontinental, but since there are a lot of Koreans, Korean songs keep playing, so the atmosphere is a little disappointing ㅎㅎ

Let’s start with the service, which was the highlight of the evening. Our server, Nate, was excellent—he explained everything clearly, was always available to take our order, and ensured our water glasses were never empty. Plates were promptly cleared, making for a smooth dining experience.

The atmosphere was decent—nothing particularly special or bad. Given that it’s a buffet, the atmosphere was upscaled.

Now, onto the most important part: the food. Unfortunately, it didn’t live up to our expectations, especially considering the price. The Alaskan King Crab was particularly disappointing—it would be more accurate to call it “Alaskan Baby Crab.”

Overall, while the service was great, the food didn’t justify the cost. For the value, we wouldn’t recommend this place. Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Price per person $100+ Food: 3 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 4

Also, we had a reservation but still waited about 30 minutes. The sushi and fish did not taste fresh.  The buffet sashimi was warm.  You have to hunt down a cup for soy sauce.  I used the huge foil cup for sauce, that meant to used for hot butter for the crab legs.

We paid for the $139 experience.  We asked for sodas and they only offered sprite and Diet Coke bc they were out of other sodas.  You think for $100 a person there will be soda.  Btw the soda is in a glass bottle at almost $9.00 a bottle.

The seabass came out cold.  The sushi was warm.  The taste was off.   Most of the buffet was not tasty.  The crab legs and shrimp was the only good seafood at the buffet.

We've gone to multiple Chubby Cattles.  Rowland Heights and Little Tokyo Chubby Cattle are in a different league compared to this place.  The sushi is so much better and the sides are better at the other Chubby Cattle restaurants.

We spoke to the manager and he only discounted our Sprites!!!!!

Go to other Chubby Group restaurants.  I was looking forward to this place.  Save your money.  I thought NikuX would be amazing since it’s so much more expensive.

Btw Shiki Buffet in Temple City tasted better than this place and it's only $40.  I never get warm sushi from that buffet.

Also, you don't get a discount here if you have the membership from Chubby Cattle.  The manager told me at least get points after you pay.  Points are nice but rather have the $300 I spent at NikuX returned.

When I’ve gone to Chubby Cattle in Rowland Heights we were sat in a corner table on a busy day.  The manager there felt so bad about us sitting at the worst table, he gave us one free membership.  And we didn’t even complain about the seating lol.  This place is like aww too bad you spent $300, hopefully we do a better job when you come back.  Why would we come back???

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNBcDYyRURREAE,Brian Won,4 stars,2025-02-01,"For a whole restaurant chain known to focus on Japanese Waygu, Niku X is supposed to be one of their flagships. To that end they deliver on the vibe and experience, but the food is rougher.

Overall the buffet is high quality, but the Waygu options, at least on the regular buffet menu, are decidedly meh - they have other Chubby Group restaurant brands that do a better job for the money. If you go for the higher end menu the experience is likely better but then you’re even more of a premium. Combined with the fact that reservations are so hard to get and I am decidedly meh.

Final note, service is indeed excellent, and Joe, our server, was terrific.

Do not take the hotel elevator. Parking is only valet, and if you get validation, it costs $16.50 for 2 hours and 30 minutes. Wagyu BBQ is better than seafood. King crab. Lobster, sashimi. $109 (Friday, Saturday, Sunday). Make a reservation 2 months in advance. If you don't want to wait, you can eat at the bar for $139. For $109, I grill the meat. For $139, the staff grills it and brings it to you. Japanese A5 top sirloin flower. chelf choice A5. It's delicious, but it's too oily to eat a lot, so it's a shame. I thought From Chef would be special, so I ordered a few, but except for the lobster tail, there's nothing that's ""wow~ delicious"", and I'm so full that it's hard to eat anything else, so I don't recommend it. I think it felt even more greasy because there were no vegetables or refreshing flavors to go with the grill. I saw oysters and scrubs on YouTube, but they weren't there the day I went. The lobster was hard to eat because the shell didn't separate because they cooked it somehow. The king crab wasn't high quality, but it was all small and low quality and not very edible, so it was a bit disappointing. You have to call 24 hours in advance for dry-aged meat. The atmosphere is good, but the servers are busy and they bring it a bit late when you order. It's a bit disappointing because there's nothing worth eating for the price. I don't think I'll come back again because the price is too high. Food: 3 Service: 3 Atmosphere: 5

Reservations are definitely recommended if you want to ensure a short wait. Management came by to check on us constantly and we enjoyed the fresh food items and the quality of meat cuts. I think this is definitely somewhere you should try at least once and see for yourself.

1. When someone's asks for the bill don't take 25 minutes to bring it
2. My water was empty the whole time
3. I didn't have any napkins the first half of my visit
4. There's a certain dish on the menu that our waiter had to cook for us and the rice on that dish got so cold because Jerry took so long to come over and cook it
5. Our grill was OFF for the first 15 minutes, we couldn't cook our meat
6. The person I was out with asked for a wine recommendation and he made very nasty remark towards her.

After all that he still expected a 20% tip? To come up and confront the table about a tip after the poor service that was provided to us was truly absurd. I was 100% gonna come back here but after that, no way! Food: 4 Service: 1 Atmosphere: 4

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURfaXNENjBRRRAB,James Choi,3 stars,2025-02-01,"I had high expectations after reading all the great reviews, so I made a reservation in mid-October. The earliest available weekend slot for a party of four was late December, so I waited almost three months for this visit. I was really looking forward to it.

But maybe my expectations were too high. I thought we would have a table where we could grill the meat ourselves, but our seats were at the bar near the windows. The ventilation was excellent, but it caused the meat to cool down very quickly, and we ended up eating everything cold.

Another disappointing point was the lack of customization for how the meat was cooked. I prefer medium-rare, while my group prefers well-done, but I had no choice but to eat everything well-done. If we had been seated at a grilling table, I would have ordered medium-rare and cooked it to my preference.

When asked why I didn’t complain, it’s because it was my first visit, and I assumed the seating was assigned and grilling tables weren’t an option for us. However, my friends later told me that they were able to grill their meat and enjoy it warm. It was disappointing, especially after waiting three months for this experience.

We ordered the $139menu, but due to the holiday season, the price had increased by $10.

That said, the service was exceptional. The servers were attentive, offering sample dishes, small cocktails, and even soju, which made the experience fun. The bar was clean, and the sushi and crab were absolutely delicious.

In conclusion, while the meat was disappointing, the other aspects of the meal were satisfying. If you plan to visit, I recommend opting for the $99 menu instead.

Nate, our server, was one of the best parts of the experience, checking in on us regularly and explaining the process slowly and clearly without making us feel silly. He really made us so comfortable with such a new experience, and I really hope he gets his accolades for it!

The food itself is amazing. The buffet felt underwhelming after we finished the tomahawk wagyu experience but everything from the chef in the all-you-can-eat was just spectacular. Even without the buffet, the all-you-can-eat plus the tomahawk for three people was more than enough.

The atmosphere is nice, very dim in the restaurant with a small lamp at your table. Might be hard to see for those with vision impairments. The music didn't really match the atmosphere in my opinion, I think I'd prefer a calmer playlist rather than an indie pop-adjacent playlist. It also was a smidgen too loud for me.

Made a reservation about a month in advance but at that time you didn't need one. The atmosphere was really good but not what I expected for the price.

The buffet food was plentiful and had great flavors. Lots of crab legs, limited Sushi but lots of things you could order from a menu that were included in your meal price.

The service was fantastic. Our server was wonderful. She gave us lots of tips on what to order from the menu and how to order from the menu. If you are celebrating a birthday, great place to go and always ask for a slushie at the end. That was the best surprise of the evening.

The slices of wagyu beef are one to two bites. You can get as much wagyu beef as you like. However, they do have a 30% waste fee if they see that you are taking more food than you can eat.

It was a nice experience and gift for my family for Christmas. Special occasions I would go again. Food: 4 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 4

This had to have been one of the worst experiences I’ve ever endured. My friends and I wanted to start our first day in Los Angeles with a bang by eating at this highly proclaimed restaurant. The service was very good they are very kind and are on top of things but it’s the food that was the issue. Straight up we got food poisoning and spent our entire first night LA puking throwing up and with fever. Not only that but have called several times to voice our concerns about how bad the food was yesterday that it got us poisoned and NO ONE ANSWERED EVERY TIME or replied to our voicemails, so here I am writing this. Travelling from Canada this was an awful way to start the trip. Safe to say it was the wrong time of bang to start the trip. Food: 1

First of, we have reservations, upon check in they told us to wait by the bar and they’ll come and get us. We ordered drinks while we waited, the check in was literally a couple of steps from the bar, instead of coming to get us they called. The upgrade to $149: the sushi platter wasn’t impressive, the crab legs platter was salty, the baked big shrimp had too much sauce. The tomahawk was too dry. The A5 wagyu wasn’t as buttery melt in your mouth that I expected. The only thing that I thought was good was the wagyu fried rice. Lastly, as we were leaving, three employees was at the check in and didn’t bother to say good bye or thank you. For the ambiance, quality and the price, I was really disappointed.

For the big party, they only give one stove to cook and you have to finish eating in 1.5 hours. That mean you can't eat much as you can't cook much, and they charge you 20% tips.

It'd be nice to know that reservations with a higher price point actually does NOT get you a grill.

Service is slow. Took an hour to get water. Most dishes that's cooked from the kitchen were NOT good. I don't think I finished any of the dishes that made it to our table. Wygu meats were NOT cooked to the right temperature and were tasteless.. what a waste of all that wygy meat. Everything was lukewarm when it's served to our table.  Sigh...

Spent more and get less. Most disappointed experience of the year.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNmd1pYTzBnRRAB,A Y,2 stars,2025-01-01,"Dined at this place, and the disappointments just keep rearing its ugly head. The reservation and the menu are misleading at best, downright scammy at worst.

Welcome to bait and switch at its finest.

First of all, nowhere in the reservation process tells you that if you reserve $139/$149, you will NOT have a grill. So that's the biggest surprise. When asked, the server was trained to ask back, ""Did you reserve a grill?"" Knowing in the reservation process, there was no indication of reserving a grill or table service. You would think that important detail should be indicated.
Not sure why their reservation system was set up this way, regardless if it's the poor planning and designing or if it's intentionally done, we felt tricked.

Second, the menu you see on their official website is a joke. You'd think the menu online is updated and is what you'll get and is what you used to decide if you'll dine here, Surprise! Most of the items we wanted are not on the ""restaurant menu"". For example, Oysters, grilled or raw, were nowhere to be found, and there were absolutely no scallops. The ultimate sashimi platter disappeared from the menu as well. And guess what, all the waygu meats that you see on the menu and it's at the buffet station that you thought was unlimited? Yeah, NOPE, you can't grab them because you ain't got a grill 😂. Jokes on you. You have to order them, and they take 30+ minutes to arrive at your table cold with no flavor. Just imagine undercooked fatty meat cold and bland in your mouth. 🤮

Finally, the food. Like I mentioned, the sliced waygu meats were gross. They were undercooked, cold, and tasteless. The Tomahawk Steak was good. It needed more black pepper and salt but was cooked perfectly. Handful selections of raw food at the buffet station were good. It's probably the only thing I enjoyed. Lobster tails were ok, but the crab legs sucked. The small dishes ""from chef"" sucked real bad. The dessert was disgusting.

NO, it's definitely not worth the price.

I wondered how I got this experience when I thought I did my research... so I skimmed through the reviews and realized almost all good reviews are made by accounts that have a total of 1 review 🤔. 🙄 Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Price per person $100+ Food: 1 Service: 2 Atmosphere: 2

The dry aged tomahawk was very good and the lobster was fantastic. I would recommend just doing the 99/109 dollar buffet experience because the 139/149 wasn’t that much more elevated. The deserts are not palatable.

When you enter, the Host area is right by the buffet line, which can cause some congestion for those looking to grab their bites. The line itself is crammed on one side of a walkway which also leads to other dining areas, the restroom and the service entrance to the kitchen.
The rest of the venue is spacious and comfortable.
The line starts with a selection of apps, with sushi, ceviche and other items. It follows by a selection of raw Wagyu beef, then ending with the 'premium' seafood selection. While the apps and Wagyu selections were fresh and tasty, the seafood selections were nothing to be desired, tasting 'cheap' in comparison to the other options.

Service was on point! I had a server named Joe C, with another server helping named Wilson, always available or visible when needed but not overwhelmingly. The servers brought out additional meats that were cooked to perfection right at the table, with a detailed explanation of each type and the best way to enjoy with various sauces. Staff kept up with table maintenance, always asking to clear instead of removing dishes in a hurry. We did not feel rushed and felt that the servers did pay proper attention to service rather than the 'flip and dip' service of many area restaurants.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNmN3Z1R0h3EAE,Kelly M,3 stars,2025-01-01,"I have mixed feelings about Niki X’s buffet. There is no doubt that the cuts are high quality and luxurious, but the meal wasn’t exactly enjoyable or delicious. There was an extreme lack of side dishes that you would  expect of a buffet. There was no fruit and very little vegetable options. Dessert options sucked. This meant you had nothing to balance out the extremely fatty cuts. Maybe it’s because they were not originally designed to be a buffet so they had very little space to spread the food items available for self-service, but the result is one feel almost sickened by the heaviness of the meal at the end of it.

They were also blasting k-pop music which, while I normally enjoy, did not really help in creating a “premium” experience because they were intentionally picked to be upbeat and high-speed songs. These songs are more suited for a bar or fast food setting and I felt like the choice was to rush customers out of the door.

Service left me a little confused. Everyone was professional, but they did not have an option for coat check in a closet when the entire restaurant is very smoky from the grill. The seating was also pretty weird; if you go as two people you have to sit next to each other which can become pretty crowded.",['https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AMBA38soQteyDfBMVd8PEZKjbMvCEORfkmjrlkZKPsGr2gE8d5UBf29wayobGVd8hbaU92QmU8nwXqiiiEnchOky6ATTbgsYUDd7hmHff8lc2ij1cg3DvE6WFW1T0uKRSxMGUnmZwmD_aQ=w1200-h900-p']

Long story short: This place is good as a one-time experience. Raw bar was only OK,--everything is salty except the sashimi and lobster, you do not get to cook your own meat (which means you will not be able to control the tempo / pace at which you eat or eat it ""fresh"" off the grill), A5 Wagyu ribeye, top blade, and tomahawk are OK, but nothing stands out especially given the $149 price point.  The one area I'd like to highlight is the amazing service. The whole staff is friendly, fast, helpful and warm!

The details:

The raw bar was just OK, the California King Crab (which looks like a mini version of the Alaska King crab) was very salty, the sashimi and lobster tails were solid, and the remaining items such as the fried chicken, salad, were OK but not what you're paying $149 for.  At the $149 price point, you will not get to cook your own meat which means that the food may come out lukewarm (like it did for us). The Tomahawk, A5 ribeye, A5 top blade were good but nothing that would make me want to come back again for. The A5 round top was very dry and I do not recommend ever ordering this. The small plates that are a must-try include the miso Chilean Sea Bass, oxtail potstickers, and katsu sando. Food: 2 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 5

Too flavorful actually, to the point where I wish I had eaten the food with rice (but I was too full already when I realized this). Wilson was our server, who was very attentive and willing to continue to get us new orders. He also had great recommendations.

It was our first time here, and my one critique is that I think the $139 option was not worth it for a first time experience. $99 option would have been good enough for us, however, because we went on a holiday, we had no choice (only the $139 option is available for holidays).

Otherwise, this is a great place for a once-in-a-while special occasion. Food: 5 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 5

I had an extremely disappointing experience at this restaurant. The food was awful, with many dishes tasting bland and unappetizing. Most importantly, the food was not fresh, which led to several of my friends experiencing severe stomach issues, including vomiting and diarrhea. We believe we all got food poisoning. I would not recommend this place to anyone and will definitely never return. Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Price per person $100+ Food: 1 Service: 1 Atmosphere: 1

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURSbjZuT193RRAB,Rodrigo “funning”,5 stars,2025-01-01,"I found out about this spot through a YouTube video & it looked like a great restaurant.  Just be aware to make a reservation you have to put down a deposit, which I did(cost depending on your party size).  There are different types of tables too(a la carte, tasting & others) & I chose the Yakiniku tasting.

First off it’s an expensive spot, if you just want to get full on meat, you can go to my favorite spot, Quarters KBBQ in Koreatown. This spot is more of an elaborate presentation & elevated dining experience. The decor and interior overall was solid & I wish I could of toured the whole location.

The tasting was absolutely phenomenal, but If I had to do it all over again, I think I would have went for the Tomahawk upgrade. I sat in an area without a view, which would have been something I’d recommend in getting to fully enjoy the experience. Also I forgot to get a good glass of red wine to pair with the offerings. The bar area was solid & I wonder if you can just walk in for just the bar area.

Each dish was carefully crafted and made to joyfully amuse your tastebuds. The meats were so fresh, seasoned perfectly & probably the best I’ve ever had, but at a cost. There is so much more to explore on their menu, like their Wagyu bone Marrow, other entrees & desserts.

I’d definitely come back again to try their tomahawk offering.  Once I try their best option & get a better view of the spot, than I can justify a full 5 stars(will take a while because I got to recoup some funds lol).  The customer service though is without a doubt excellent and deserving of a 5 because they cater to a lot of the needs you had as a customer.

Just be aware it’s valet mainly or discounted parking but not free.  I walked to this spot to avoid the parking hoopla. Enjoy the spot & yolo responsibly!

***updated***
Recently did the Wagyu Tomahawk Tasting and it was phenomenal, just check out the pictures and videos. Originally I rated this spot four stars for their sushi mainly but after this tomahawk experience, it’s now a full 5 stars.

***Update***
I tried their $150 all you can eat wagyu buffet with seafood and lobster with my parents. It was phenomenal and thanks to Kelly our server for an excellent experience.

My warning to you is eat to be satisfied and don’t go overboard otherwise they will charge you for wasting food. Luckily my parents and I ate it all but I should have stopped a few plates ago. The Wagyu quality was top notch and the menu items were excellent.

For the price it’s worth it and I would say pace yourself.

Their buffet bar was limited and dessert? I guess to be fair, they're not known for desserts. 🤣. Ambiance is great though.  Will i go back here again?

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN2bWREbC1RRRAB,#JourneyOfThe C,3 stars,2024-12-01,"First, let me say that my husband and I traveled from Texas to celebrate our Birthday at this restaurant. He is a seafood foodie so it was one of his special birthday requests to fly to LA and eat here. The atmosphere was dimly lit, kind of intimate in appearance however you are seated with others and not at a private table. The music was a bit loud so conversation had to be louder. We had an amazing waiter JJ who was nothing but TOP NOTCH all night long!! The food was not worth the price unfortunately 😕. The seafood was cold seafood. I'm used to my crab legs being hot and boiled with flavor. My husband loves all kinds hot or cold seafood and he said it was sub par. The Wagyu Beef requires a special pallette because it was very greasy. And the desserts were not sweet at all and were just horrible. I felt really cheated on what was supposed to be a superior experience! And for the cost of this experience....when you travel this far for a birthday experience....well let's just say I am super disappointed. Our waiter sent over the manager, who was super nice and very understanding, provided an alternative for food options, however we were really already over it. He provided us a 60$ discount which still made the experience cost 160$ plus the 16.50 for parking. I do not recommend this experience unless you specifically like cold seafood and wagyu beef. But i will always recommend JJ our waiter! Thank you guys and hope this helps! Food: 1 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 3

We had high hopes for our visit to Niku X, but unfortunately, the experience fell far short of expectations. As a group of eight, we booked the full-service option and arrived at 8:30 PM for our 8:45 reservation. Despite arriving early, we weren’t seated until 9 PM, which was frustrating and set the tone for the evening.

Once seated, things only got worse. The grill at our table was broken, and we were told there was no other table available to accommodate us. Since we paid for the full-service option, we weren’t even allowed to grill our own meat, which we would have preferred given the circumstances.

The service was painfully slow. It took over an hour for the first round of our limited 15 items to arrive, leaving us with little time to enjoy the meal within the 2-hour limit. The presentation of the meat was subpar—cuts were not well-prepared or what you'd expect from a high-end restaurant.

The most disappointing part was the quality of the food. The A5 wagyu beef from our second order was chewy and lacked the signature tenderness you’d expect from wagyu. It was so poor that we questioned whether it was even wagyu at all.

While some staff members were polite, the overall experience was not worth the $1,500 we paid. Waiting for food, dealing with a broken grill, and being unable to enjoy the meal as promised made for a truly disappointing evening. We won’t be returning and can’t recommend this restaurant.

The wagyu was fantastic, the seafood was mostly very delicious, and the sides that you order from the kitchen were all very good as well. Being a huge seafood fan, I was primarily interested in eating the various fish and shellfish options. While I really enjoyed 90% of the seafood selection, I will say that the crab and lobster were a bit underwhelming. One of the crabs (can't remember which kind) was very salty, while the lobster had a somewhat rubbery texture. Aside from the seafood, the beef options were all fantastic and melt-in-your-mouth. The cocktails were well-made and delicious, but seemed light on alcohol. We also ordered a couple of soft drinks, which were fairly expensive and not a good value ($6 for a tiny glass bottle of Coke). The service was very good throughout the entire dining experience and I was impressed that the servers came to change our grill often without us asking. The primary reason I am taking off a star from my review is that our server essentially bribed us into giving him a good review on Yelp by offering to comp our soft drinks. I assumed that meant we could write him a good review on our own terms, but instead he took our phones, copied and pasted an AI-generated review on Yelp, and asked us to post it. It was honestly quite uncomfortable and it makes me question how legitimate the other reviews are for this establishment. Just something to be aware of. Otherwise, I really enjoyed the meal and would recommend Niku X to other seafood and wagyu lovers.

But tonight, we were completely underwhelmed by Niku X. This restaurant  most definitely underdelivered for the $139 that they were charging. As a family, we eat fresh seafood regularly. So, we know what freshness tastes like. Perhaps it was the Thanksgiving long weekend and their suppliers had hard time delivering fresh seafood, or perhaps the restaurant's latest delivery was the day before Thanksgiving, when we visited the restaurant on Saturday, the seafood simply tasted unfresh. Many fish dishes had a mushy/slimy texture to them, and the shrimps/lobsters tasted unusually plain. The A5 Wagyu beef was tender, but they were all served on a large cold plate. By the time they were delivered to our table, the Wagyu pieces were all lukewarm. And eating beef with high fat content at a lukewarm temperature was definitely not an enjoyment, and even the Wagyu fried rice was lukewarm when served. The manager did come out and apologize, which was a nice gesture. I might try this restaurant again in the future, but will definitely avoid long weekend at all cost. BTW, I tried to scan the receipt using their Chubby app to accumulate points in the parking garage, but the app said it could only scan while we were physically inside the restaurant. So, for those of you who wish to use their app to accumulate points, please make sure to do so before you leave their premises.

From chef: they delivered really slowly and the most items were really dry and bland. (But katsu sando and yaki udon were too salty lol)
Buffet station : really seriously dirty, and I felt no one really not cared the cleanliness. I lost my appetite when I saw the buffet station. For the public health, please pay more attention to maintain the cleanliness! Especially this restaurant mainly carry seafood, but I felt dangerous when I imagine to have this food from the station. (This seafood area has stinky smells, nasty)
The wagyu was not that crazy bad, but never worth with this price.

Just highly recommend to all,

Please don't take a risk of your health with paying.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNQdHY3cC1BRRAB,R. Min,3 stars,2024-12-01,"I'll admit that I currently have food coma from overeating, but I am still a bit disappointed from the experience. The joint is basically just a bougie buffet.

The place has ambiance. Decor and staff make you feel like it's an elevated dining experience. But I came here to stuff my face for 2 hours, not admire the lighting.

To make it simple, I'll just rate what I ate as a list. I don't feel like typing paragraphs of pulp. We both got better things to do.

All the A5 wagyu:
Wow, melt in your mouth beefy goodness. After this, anything leaner will just be leather. Make sure you don't grill it too long. Rare to medium is the way to go for this stuff.

All the other beef:
It's okay. But bad. If you want to try it, do it before the A5.

Beef tataki:
Yummy. Had three rounds of it. But that's if you like rare/raw beef. The sauce/marinade is what made it delicious. Refreshing, but I'm sure a more accurate descriptor could be used.

Lobster:
Not bad, but kind of boring in it's own. Luckily they have plenty of things to dip it in. If you don't like it cold, throw it in the grill for a few minutes.

King crab:
Huge disappointment. SO SALTY. I know they do this so you don't eat a mountain of it, but this is a bit extreme. The first round of four pieces is all we ate. It's as salty as the typical snow crab at your local cheap Chinese buffet. NIKUX, I guess you've accomplished your mission since we ate only one round.

Snow crab:
Didn't touch after eating the king crab. I would be flabbergasted if it was actually less salty. But I doubt it.

Selection of raw fish:
Tuna is okay. Yellowtail could be better. Didn't try the poke though.

Oysters:
Wow, you gotta love oysters to consume these. So fishy and ""oyster"" tasting. Yeah, yeah, I'm an oyster amateur. Or maybe it's old?

Scallops:
Fresh and sweet. Complete opposite to the oysters. Not fishy at all.

There are many items you order through server and they bring from the kitchen. Didn't get to try all of them, but the sea bass was tasty. The sando was yummy also, but you don't want to fill up of that stuff. Didn't do any of the rice dishes since it wasn't cooked with enough water when we ate the yakisuki at the beginning of the meal.

Desserts:
Whatever. The chocolate mousse thingy was the best out of the selection.

One thing that I really didn't like is that when you're done with dinner and you've paid your bill, the server will ask you to leave them a review by scanning a QR code. But the server will click on the options in your phone to give themselves a review and submit it before you even know what's going on. A bit shady.

Is it worth $99? Yes, because of the real A5 and the lobster. But other than that, nothing there makes want to go back and have it again. Been there, done that, move on. Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Price per person $100+ Food: 3 Service: 4 Atmosphere: 4

Kevin was our server, he was knowledgeable of the different cuts of meat and cooking techniques for each. I have dined at a few Chubby Cattle Restaurants and there are a few items I would like to see improved at this sister company; such as cleanliness of grills (grill was black with previous diners cooked food' also and allergy risk)upon seating  and cleanliness of bathrooms( were one of the first seated customer for dinner at 5pm and bathroom was filhty and trash was overflowing), better variety of desserts and birthday celebration offerings such as a plated dessert with happy birthday signs. Cocktail shrimps and shelled prawns were overcooked, Alaskan Crab legs seasoned well but also sadly overcooked. Lobster was cooked well. Sashimi was fresh. Salad bar and raw vegetables lacked in variety for the price point.

I would give a 3 star rating for food, variety and atmosphere...however, the staff was very attentive and very personable bringing it up 1 star. Price per person $100+ Food: 3 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 3

The food was already amazing because it A5 wagyu everything and the seafood was fresh. The garlic butter goes so well with the lobster tail, king crab legs and snow crab. The sashimi were so fresh and fish melted in my mouth.

The miso Chilean seabass skewers, lamb lollipop, oxtail potsticker and Tom yum soup were so delicious. The wagyu sukiyaki was so good too.

Our server, Mike, was friendly and helpful. However, the buffet bar was way too dark, especially the sushi section. The lobster was tiny, like the ones you'd find at a Chinese buffet, and it was dry. The King crab was way too salty, had to drink water just to get it down. The made-to-order dishes were hit or miss. The meat was decent, but I’m not into wagyu. I prefer american ribeye which was good. Dessert options were limited, and honestly, the taste wasn’t great. I’d rather go to Chubby Cattle and pay half the price for a better experience.

When we arrived, they acknowledged her birthday, but that was the last time it was mentioned, which was disappointing. We’d also reserved a tomahawk steak and confirmed it with the waiter at the start of the meal, but it was somehow forgotten about by their team. We only realized this toward the end of our meal, and it took 30 more minutes just to come out, tried enjoying it but that made us late for valet and added to our costs.

The service overall felt off. Our waiter checked on us much less while being noticeably more attentive to other tables. For the price and the occasion, I expected a much higher level of service and attention to detail.

They previously had tasting menus available but have recently shifted to a $99 unlimited wagyu and seafood buffet format.

I was able to experience this new offering last night and I have to say WOWWWWWW!

I’m generally skeptical of the buffet format because sometimes it affects quality but in Niku X’s case not only do they keep up their 5 star quality but they also maintain such high levels of service even in this format. You have access to a variety of items at the wagyu and seafood bar from 5 different wagyu cuts that you grill at your table to lobster, king/snow crab, oysters, scallops, shrimp, hot items and salad but also you can order several items on a tasting basis like a wagyu katsu sando bite, mini sukiaki, oxtail dumplings and more!

The restaurant is also still one of the most beautiful in DTLA.

I couldn’t get enough of it all, left stuffed and very happy.

You’re told at the beginning that you have a 2 hour time limit which is plenty of time and you can order items from the side menu provided up to 90 minutes into the reservation.

Validated parking available for a reduced fee at the Intercontinental (valet only). Street parking depending on time (watch the signs!) . Or if you plan to do shopping 7th and Fig is a good self parking option across the street.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMzMGRPcEJBEAE,Bryant Quan,3 stars,a year ago,"Things you should know:

The beef quality was good, but largely raw and the only seasonings available to you are pepper and salts.

The lobster tails were tiny (not much larger than some large prawns) but that's okay because it's all you can eat. The king crab was smaller than average but again, okay because all you can eat.

Aside from the wagyu, lobster, and crab, there actually isn't much else to enjoy so come here with that in mind.

Lobster, king crab and large head prawns are only served cold.

Not all tables get to grill food on their own. Sometimes you can get seated at a table where everything must be cooked for you by a kitchen.

Some items are one order per person, including their most premium dishes like the ones that have uni or caviar, which is presumably some of their most expensive items.

They no longer have the bone marrow.

Despite making reservations weeks in advance and informing them of a birthday, they ran out of their caviar/uni/sashimi dish which is limited per guest.

You can order grilled king crab but it's one per person (weird, just grill it yourself at your table, if you've got a table with a grill).

Drinks are not ayce including soft drinks.

Located in the Wilshire Grand Center, this upscale Japanese yakiniku restaurant offers a spectacular mix of flavor and presentation. The unlimited king crab, lobster tails, and Japanese A5 Wagyu are some of the main showstoppers in the buffet lineup. The atmosphere is both refined and lively, with tableside sukiyaki and smoke-infused platters adding drama to each course. Although it’s a splurge, NikuX as well as our server for the evening, Nate C. made every detail count, leaving us with a lasting impression of Japanese fine dining with a modern twist.

Make sure to make your reservation if you intend to try this place out.
To paraphrase this experience, it was pleasant but yet disappointing. A5 Japanese Wagyu was good but the lobster (More closer to a crawfish) in my opinion,  King Crab, and oysters were less desirable. Service was excellent (Mike was our server).  Parking will be the Intercontinental Hotel Valet. Make sure to get your valet ticket validated. They charged me $16.50 with validation, which was well worth it.

Kevin, who was in charge of our table, provided attentive and courteous service, and his recommendation of the Miso Chilean Seabass was even better than Nobu’s. Each dish was fresh and made with evident care.

I was particularly impressed by how Kevin and the floor manager consistently checked in on our meal throughout the dining experience. Their willingness to listen to even minor feedback was something I had not encountered in any other buffet, which left a lasting impression.

It was a rare opportunity to enjoy a satisfying luxury buffet in LA. Personally, I found NikuX to be a more valuable dining experience than the buffet at Cafe S in H Hotel, in terms of quality, pricing, and service.

The only availability was 139$. 3 people paid for 139$ and only received 1 tomahawk steak. The waiter was doing good when it wasn't busy, but the service went down dramatically once it got busy ( the server started spilling water from a bottle of water you pay 9$ for). Buffet food was good, but only if it was available when you were in line (multiple items i was looking for were not available about 60-70% of the time I went to the buffet line). We ordered 3 chefs special sashimi platter (came with the 139$, and was one per person) we received one bowl. There was not one piece per person (the platter was presented nicely though). For the price you pay (99$/139$), I would expect food to be readily available consistently and better service. I would not go back.

If you're going for the buffet, make sure you make a reservation if possible! Otherwise, you'll end up sitting at the bar and obligated to take the $139 option (that's what happened to my group of 4), And me being someone who doesn't love seafood, the $139 option is overpriced for me. But honestly, I think it was the better experience, even though it was our first time there and we missed out on being able to cook our own food. The bartenders Joseph (and I forgot the other guys name... sorry 😬) were awesome! They were so attentive and helpful in the food selection process. On top of that, they were great conversationalists and artists of concoctions. Even the other staff members that crossed our path were really cool. It was like we sat in the VIP area and were the only ones there! 😂 All the food was delicious and there were many top notch meat selections. The sea bass is a MUST try! 💋👌🏼 The vibe is casual but classy. (Heads up, though, they only play K-Pop so if you go I hope you're either a fan or don't mind.) It was an experience and I would definitely go back!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURYaEoyZVZ3EAE,Surf Wave,5 stars,a year ago,"I went to Niku X for the second time last night. I requested Wilson L. for my server because he gave us top-notch service the 1st time we ever visited. I brought back my family and it was a fantastic night. I read and saw some recent reviews on both IG and YT complaining that they were left hungry and servers deliberately withheld food for long periods of time or wouldn't refill the buffet. I absolutely did not see any of that the entire two hours I ate there.

Our server Wilson always made sure to check on us frequently and make sure our orders came out in a timely manner. If there was a little wait on any item, he always came to let us know immediately and asked if we wanted anything else. However we never waited too long for anything and we had a delicious and fantastic meal. Also I never saw the buffet empty like some reviewers said. There always was a refill on food and honestly it was worth every penny to dine here.

There are so many things available in our $139 buffet that honestly 1 trip and even 2 trips is not enough to try out the entire menu. There are still menu items we have not tried because we got full early on. I don't understand why one YouTuber complained that he spent $140 for buffet but was still hungry afterwards because they didn't refill his food or fulfill most of his orders on time. We never experienced any of that both times we dined. And we felt the food was fantastic. But you have to try to see what you like. I didn't really like the sushi and sashimi platter from the $140 buffet menubut I enjoyed the sashimi that was in the buffet line instead. I thought the oxtail potstickers were average but all of their Wagyu Beef absolutely delicious and amazing. I could go on and on but you really need to try and what find what you like. Most of what is offered is absolutely delicious.
I plan on coming back to celebrate more special occasions here.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNYal9MNnRRRRAB,Tesia Lo,1 star,a year ago,"If I can rate this place as 0/5 I would. I was utterly appalled and frankly disappointed in this establishment. If you want cheaper AYCE wagyu/sushi, I think driving to one of their sister restaurants is more cost efficient (such as Yumiyaki, Mikiya, or even Chubby Cattle). Those other restaurants are cheaper and judging by how they serve sushi and Japanese Wagyu also, it's better to get those dishes there than pay a butt load for this place.

We got the upgraded option of $139, and opted out to order any large steaks that you pre- order (ex. tomahawks range from 35-40 oz, and some other options that you can select of your choosing.

Service: Extremely horrendous. I had runners/staff members not even know the simple aspect of having certain condiments at their restaurant. One runner said they didn't have tabasco, but had chili oil; only for a FOH manager to come by and say they have no tabasco and chili oil. Our server kept getting our orders wrong which caused a delay in our meat being served because we were sat at a non-grill table. Our server admitted to getting the orders wrong completely. Wait was over 15-20 minutes long in between waiting for the next round. Runners/servers also kept serving dishes on the side of the table even if there was room in the middle of the table. Dishes were not cleaned up. I had almost 4 plates stacked just from appetizers because I was starving between rounds of meat never coming essentially.

Ambiance: The restaurant is nice, but with the amount of complaining tables surrounding our area, I definitely didn't think that I was at a high end semi fancy restaurant at all. Interior is dark and nice, but the buffet line could use some work as it is a narrow walkway and some patrons decide to stand and block the way as well.

Food: Subpar at best. If I wanted to get expensive cut meat and be paying for 139 for it, I should be getting top quality. It was lukewarm at minimum every time we received the meat. It wasn't cooked to our medium rare liking, and some of the meats weren't the ones we ordered since our server got out order wrong multiple times.

Manager Education: Its pretty comical when even the managers of this establishment aren't well trained, couldn't answer simple questions of why the wait was taking so long, why the service was horrible, and why the raw seafood bar was completely barren for a great portion of the time. When we asked these questions, they completely invalidated our party and didn't try to resolve the solution or provide alternatives in any way possible. Pretty disappointing for a restaurant group that I've had pretty adequate experiences at their other sister restaurants.

Overall, I am not stepping into this establishment again. This wasn't even half of the entire experience. I saw an influencer table get up and not touch their food or pay at all, and then another couple order the tomahawk and have a few bites and left, and then the table that got seated after they left also got up and complained why the food was delayed and the service was pretty unbearable. I advise eating at their sister restaurants for much cheaper like chubby cattle, yumiyaki, or even mikiya. At least you'll pay for the service you're getting and the quality of food. One of the worst experiences ever and to top it off, I sent an email to their feedback group and they promised they would get back in 48 hours, and they never got back to me :(.

Booked full service for 2 ($139pp) on a Thursday night. Arrived a few minutes late due to LA traffic - NikuX is located in the same building as the Intercontinental hotel in DTLA, on the second floor. Seated within 5 minutes in a nice window seat.

With the full-service menu, you get to order unlimited amounts of everything on the menu and some special items once.

Unlimited items: some items require preparation and you need to order the day before your reservation, such as the 45-day aged tomahawk - which we ordered. When we sat down, we immediately ordered Japanese A5 ribeye and tenderloin.

What we liked:
- Japanese A5 steaks - sliced thin, good quality, not a lot in each serving but because of the heavy fat content it fills you up quickly!
- Wagyu fried rice - whoever is working the wok on the rice is doing a great job!
- Unlimited lobster tails and king crab legs at the buffet - served chilled on ice, but supplied with lemons and butter and very fresh. And they’ve cut the lobster tails in half to make it even easier to eat.
- Miso Sea bass - served in “cubes” that were pan fried and served on a skewer. Very tasty

Not fans of:
- Shishito pepper

The special items (limited to one per person)
- Sashimi special - uni, toro, salmon, caviar - what’s not to like? Very tasty. Small portion but it was very good. I had both portions for the two of us that went…yum!
- King crab stuffed - served hot - very good
- Big head shrimp - served hot - also very good

Buffet - shrimp, other wagyu food options, like curry, fresh salad, vegetables, tempura - all unlimited and self-serve. Good selection.

Cocktails / wine - expansive menu - prices are about what you would expect for LA prices.

Service - Wissal was our server - very friendly - informative and professional. Thanks for a great time! In terms of the food service, honestly it was a bit slow. I know you get 2 hours to eat but we often sat 15-20 minutes with no steak despite ordering. That would probably be my only point of negative feedback. Quality was great. We left super full - but the long lag times to get cooked steak out on the full-service option was a bit disappointing. Next time, I might skip the full service and just get the self-service and cook my own meat over a Korean BBQ and take the wagyu they had at the buffet.

Now - if you make it to the end and you still have room for dessert - you can try it. Their tiny dessert station didn’t have anything great in my opinion. We tried a few things and were underwhelmed. But hey - we were already bursting at the seams from all the Wagyu :)

This guy is a natural and should be walking the restaurant on top of being upfront. With the diverse crowd he needs a promotion!

The food was excellent! I don’t understand the few poor reviews. I mean for $99 the selection you receive is fantastic. Couldn’t even get close to trying all the selections. I just focused on the delicious king crab, lobster, White Sea bass, sashimi and Wagyu. I wish I had an extra stomach, but had to tap out a happy camper.

It truly brought out the flavors of the Wagyu. Niku X has an elegant atmosphere that’s perfect for a special occasion. Meng’s service fit right in with the upscale vibe.

I’m sitting here waiting to be seated and pissed so stay tuned for part 2 of the actual review of the food to see if it’s worth the $139 price tag, so annoyed rn🤦🏻‍♀️ Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Price per person $100+ Food: 4 Service: 1 Atmosphere: 1

At 139 yuan, this buffet is absolutely not worth the price. The service was also awful. They gave us a tiny table, and after we finished eating, no one came to clear our plates; we had to call them multiple times before they came. If you want to order drinks, remember, they are extra, and the staff won't tell you! The only difference between the 99 and 139 yuan buffets is that you can only order one of four dishes per person, and each serving only contains two pieces of food. Almost all the seafood was very stale; the only decent thing was the cake. We had to find a server three times and waited over ten minutes to pay the bill. A truly awful experience!

We got our table at 9:05 just and was informed that the kitchen would close at 10:30pm. When our server later on told us that last call is at 10 because the kitchen is closing we got surprised.

This ment that our session that would be 2 hours from start now in reality only was 45 min. We had prebooked months ahead and was really looking forward to try this place, the disappointment is quite huge

The food we got to try was really good, i would recommend to take the 99 option were you have the opportunity to grill the meat yourself.

So overall it is with a visit but if possible try to book an early sitting so that you have plenty of time.

Update: I reached out to Niku X according to their wish but they have not responded to that ( it was 5 days ago). Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Price per person $100+ Food: 5 Service: 1 Atmosphere: 4 Parking options Paid parking lot, Free street parking

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURubGJuTFNnEAE,Lance Barker,5 stars,a year ago,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at NIKU X in downtown Los Angeles for a birthday celebration, and I can't say enough about the incredible service we received from our server, Joe Chen. From the moment we sat down, Joe made us feel welcomed and valued, creating a warm and friendly atmosphere that set the tone for the evening.

Joe was attentive without being intrusive, ensuring that our drinks were always full and that we were enjoying our meal. Speaking of drinks, they were absolutely on point! Each cocktail was crafted to perfection, complementing the high-quality food we enjoyed throughout our meal.

The food itself was nothing short of exceptional. Each dish was beautifully presented and bursting with flavor, making it a true culinary experience. Joe’s recommendations were spot on, and his passion for the menu really enhanced our dining experience.

If you're looking for a restaurant that offers not only delicious food and drinks but also outstanding service, I highly recommend NIKU X. Be sure to ask for Joe Chen – he truly made our birthday dinner unforgettable! Food: 5 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 5

I had an 8:15 reservation that was completely ignored upon our arrival. We ended up waiting for over 45 minutes, only to be treated with attitude and rudeness by the staff. When we inquired about our table, instead of an apology, we were met with blatant disrespect. It felt as though they were prejudiced towards my wife, who’s from Brazil, treating us differently compared to other guests who arrived later and were promptly seated.

The lack of professionalism, common courtesy, and basic respect was astonishing. With so many great restaurants in Los Angeles, I strongly urge others to stay away from this place. Do not waste your time or money on NIKU X – you deserve better.

We had to follow up 3 times, the drinks were still not ready. The drinks came out only after we had already been seated at the table. Even then we still had to follow up on one of the drinks as it did not arrive. None of the items were refilled, there were no dessert items left at all, we were able to try just 1 round of wagyu because they were not refilled. Nothing is refilled so there were times the group was just watching for refills. Very disappointing that they claim this is ayce but then don't refill any of the items. The quality was excellent when the items were refilled but I could've had a better experience just paying a la carte instead of waiting like scavengers. Disappointing to hear that others got free champagne for a birthday while we were given nothing. I do not recommend coming her after 8 because it seems like they do not refill after then.

I was pleased to see the improvement in communication, which allowed me to secure a reservation with ease this time. This level of responsiveness is what I expect from such a high-caliber establishment.

As always, the service from the staff remains phenomenal. Their attention to detail and willingness to accommodate guests is consistently impressive, which is why I keep coming back. The entire dining experience, from the quality of food to the professionalism of the staff, continues to be exceptionally positive.

The all-you-can-eat (AYCE) menu at Niku X is still one of my favorites, especially with their premium seafood offerings and Japanese A5 beef--a must-try highlight of the buffet.

I recommend going right when they open because it's less crowded and the the buffet lines are much shorter. Cheers!

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNuX1ppNEVBEAE,Cesar Torres,1 star,a year ago,"Honest Experience at Niku X in LA (900 Wilshire)
First time 9/28/24

I had high hopes for Niku X, but the overall experience was quite disappointing. First off, much of the food was served cold and lacked flavor. The dipping sauces were sparse, and the tomahawk steak, which we expected to be a showstopper, was not only small for a table of six but also had burnt ends.

The crab legs were served cold as well, and the garlic butter tasted like it had no garlic in it at all. Even the hot meats were completely unseasoned, which was a huge letdown. This is far from what I’d expect from a restaurant claiming Michelin star-level quality.

Another issue was the table itself—it was far too small for the number of people and dishes. Plates and cups were constantly bumping into each other, which made the meal feel cramped and uncomfortable. For a fine dining experience, you’d think the space would be better suited for the number of dishes they serve.

On the positive side, our waitress Wissal was wonderful, and her service was top-notch. No complaints there. However, I was annoyed to find that we were charged for water without being informed in advance. I don’t mind paying, but a heads-up would’ve been nice.

The drinks were strong, but at the price point they charge, you'd expect nothing less. In the end, Niku X did not live up to the Michelin star standards they claim to meet. For the cost, the experience left a lot to be desired.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIMzRYMFR3EAE,Joe Mendoza,5 stars,a year ago,"Beautiful restaurant with excellent service, and the food was well worth the price! We opted for the VIP treatment where you didn't have to cook your own food.  Their American wagyu and Japanese A5 were to die for, so delicious and tender! This alone made it worth the trip! And then there's the  Raw oysters and sashimi which were super fresh! Their snow crab legs and lobster tails were so so good dipped in their lemon garlic butter sauce. Chilean sea bass was very tasty and cooked perfectly. I will say that I had a couple items I tried that didn't quite satisfy, but I still give this place 5 stars because the food I did eat most of were GREAT AND THE SERVICE was AMAZING. Thank you Mikey!  One of the things I wasn't too happy with lamb lollipop, which lasted much flavor. Another was the tomahawk steak because some of it was a little tough and didn't compare to the A5 tenderloin.  But then again, nothing compared to the A5 Tenderloin, IMO.  Also, they didn't have too much of a dessert selection.  We had a 9:15 pm reservation, so it's likely we came too late to enjoy a spread of sweets. But since I was so stuffed with all the unbelievably good food, I didn't mind skipping dessert. All in all, I highly recommend this place and can't wait to go again!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURIbVpuQTBBRRAB,Christopher Woo,5 stars,a year ago,"Had a reservation for 2 for Niku X on Friday night at 9:30 PM. Niku X is located in the Wilshire-Grand Building on the 2nd floor on the opposite side of the Intercontinenal Hotel. Found street parking on Figueroa & 6th. We took the escalators up and were about 20 minutes early, we were greeted by the hostess and led to the waiting area and given a drinks menu. Originally our reservation was for the $99 option but we decided to do the $139 instead (unfortunately we did not get to do the tomahawk that is part of the $139 option as we needed to preorder by 1:30 PM). We waited about 5 minutes and were led to our giant table with a grill in the center. Mikey introduced himself to us as our server and he was cool, friendly and very attentive along with the other staff.

To start off there is the self-serve buffet style salad bar (NIKU salad, mushrooms & zucchini for grilling, seafood salad, kimchi, fruit), then the crudo bar (wagyu tartare, bluefin tuna toro w/ scallion, salmon, A5 wagyu tartare, amberjack, halibut, scallop, ceviche), then the hot foods (white rice topped with furikake, wagyu curry, wagyu mapo tofu, fried veggies, shrimp tempura and then the meat locker (Japanese A5 chef's choice steak, Japanese A5 top sirloin, American Wagyu Ribeye, American Wagyu Striploin, American Wagyu Tenderloin) and then the chilled seafood (oysters, scallops, lobster tail, snow crab legs & king crab legs) and the condiments (lemon, cajun butter, pink peppercorn mignonette & yuzu cocktail sauce) and lastly a small dessert section.

There were items on the menu that you had to order through your server. We tried the potato pave, oxtail potstickers, A5 wagyu sando, miso Chilean sea bass, wagyu tallow shishito peppers, wagyu sukiyaki, and lamb lollipop. Because of the $139 option we were each allowed to order 1 item from the Chef's Special Seafood so we chose the ultimate sashimi platter (assorted sashimi, uni, foie gras, caviar) and sushi platter which was incredible. The quality of fish was very fresh, each piece of sushi was dabbed with a little sauce/tare and the slightly acidic vinegar rice was perfect and really opened up the appetite.

The meat what can I say? Every single piece melted in the mouth, after a slight sear on both sides of the beef and got great maillard reaction. You can season your meat with the condiments at the table  (salt, pepper, chili powder, wasabi salt, house blend, truffle salt). Our favorites were definitely the Japanese cuts, they were VERY rich and a little goes a long way but it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience throughout being able to enjoy small dishes of quality seafood from the crudo bar or some salad  in between the rich meat and most definitely the seafood... not many places offer king crab legs so this is legit, crab crackers and crab shears provided as well, the crab meat were both so naturally sweet with a bit of brininess from the salt water, id say the crab legs alone make it worth it, just go to Costco and take a look at the cooked red king crab legs. I didn't try any of the desserts or hot food items except for the wagyu fried rice and shrimp tempura but I'll definitely be back to enjoy the full experience, hopefully with an earlier reservation time.

Also, this is a restaurant part of the Chubby Group (Chubby Cattle, Chubby Curry, Wagyu House, Yumiyaki, Mikiya, Chubby Skewers) so make sure you get the app and points!

The entire dining experience was phenomenal. It’s something new, the servers explained the ordering process clearly.  We got the $139  dining experience and would totally go back again. Taylor was very attentive and we were celebrating my friend’s newly wed  / homecoming from his Italy trip and he let us sample imported sake from Japan. But what separates this place than any establishments, is the attitude of the staff. From the hostess, servers, management, bar tenders. They were all friendly and approachable and we ended up getting 2 rounds of drinks on the way out because the drinks were top-shelf and  the bar tenders can actually say Hi with a smile.

The buffet offers two price options, $99 and $139, both worth it for the unlimited lobster, A5 wagyu, oysters, and king crab legs. The food was fresh and delicious, and there's also a variety of hot dishes, sashimi, and desserts--including cakes from a collaboration with Freesia bakery.

A highlight was the Yakitsuki, cooked fresh and melting in your mouth, though it's limited to one per person. The chef's specials, like miso Chilean sea bass and wagyu sando, were also outstanding.

The service was attentive, and the atmosphere elegant yet cozy. If you're a lobster lover, this buffet is a must-try! Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Price per person $100+ Food: 5 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 5 Recommended dishes Wagyu Tartare

We visited on 8/31 for the AYCE tasting menu for $99 and it was a big disappointment in all aspects.

To start off we had a reservation on OpenTable for 7:30PM and we arrived at 7:25PM only to wait an additional hour until we were sat.

The AYCE selection was mostly absent, the walk up bar for food was empty most of the night. Only American wagyu options were available in the fridge, no Japanese wagyu AT ALL. Crudo station was empty with exception of a few small dishes being set out occasionally that would go quickly. NO KING CRAB was ever available on any of our visits to the buffet line.

While eating, my wife bit into a small plastic bead pictured below which appears to be a hair bead that was somehow fallen into the food she ate. Absolutely disgusting!!!

As for the service, it was also atrocious!! Once we were sat, we ordered waters for the table and a kids cup for my son. My wife and I received our water but our son’s never came so we asked again. Wait 20min, still no water so we ask again. We wait again no one comes to the table to check on us or asks if we need anything until 20min later when a bus boy comes around and asks and we finally got the water for my son 40minutes after we got ours. After this, I walked to the host stand to speak to the manager about how we were upset about the food/water situation and was told that a manager would be sent over but guess what? No manager ever showed. We then asked for our check through the bus boy and waited roughly 15min before asking again because no one ever brought it. A manager was finally brought our check and we made him aware of the situation. Manager was very apologetic and offered to comp one of our meals.

I would never visit this establishment again nor would I ever recommend it.

We arrived at our designated reservation time and were told it’s going to be a short wait because they are just cleaning tables. I had to check three times with the front desk only to be seated after 45 minutes because the front of house had to set up our table herself.

Now for the buffet selection, some items were already out of stock like oysters and fried rice. The steaks also took time to replenish. Very disappointed that they also ran out of the A5 wagyu which is one of the main reasons people go to this place. From the hot menu, the lamb chop and katsu sandwich (which is what most people talk about online) were also sold out!

The service left much to be desired as well as our drinks took forever to arrive and when we asked for another round of iced tea — they ran out (how does this happen?).

Unlimited king crab, snow crab, lobster, oysters, mussels, and, you guys, I was freakin’ FLOORED when I saw the fridge of A5 wagyu steaks that you can get yourself...I've never seen anything like it! You literally make your money back with just this, this is PEAK LUXURY.

Not only is this wagyu and seafood heaven, there are amazing mini sushi bowls, premium nigiri, wagyu curry rice, and chef-made dishes like miso Chilean sea bass, lamb lollipops, wagyu udon noodles, and wagyu sukiyaki.

Had to open up my second stomach for dessert, their dessert station is absolutely stunning. They rotate the desserts featuring local businesses, and I was so excited when I saw today’s was from the viral Freesia Cakes!

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURyaFAtVzl3RRAB,Casey Wong,1 star,Edited a year ago,"We originally had a 7:15 reservation on Friday July 12 and once we checked in, we were told that there were a few tables ahead of us and we could wait in the waiting area/lobby. We assumed it would be a 10-15 minute wait but 30 minutes had already passed before any type of update. We spoke to one of the front managers and he had apologized for the wait but did not have an estimated time for the next available table. He offered us the regular menu to order some appetizers while we were still waiting in the lobby, so we had placed an order for 2 Japanese Albacore with Crispy Onion handrolls to tide over our appetite. We were waiting roughly for 10-15 minutes for our order, but thankfully we were called for an open table.

We were finally seated at 8:15pm and immediately placed our food order for the DineLA menu. We received our first order of the crudo along with our order of the 2 albacore handrolls at 8:22pm. We quickly devoured those 2 items after waiting an hour to be seated. We were waiting on our next course but we did not receive it until 8:49pm. We received our Dashi Yukke Soup at a warm but not hot temperature and 27 minutes after our first course.

At this point, we were extremely hungry and disappointed in the level of execution and service at the restaurant. To wait nearly 30 minutes in between each course was completely absurd. If we continued with the same pace, our dinner would last 2 hours and we would end our dinner at 10pm. We spoke with the manager and he apologized for the wait and offered to ask the chef if they could expedite the rest of our menu. We then got the rest of the menu (Chimichurri Bone Marrow and A5 Wagyu Yakiniku) 10 minutes later. We also received the Fried Brussel Sprouts on the house.

To conclude dinner, they also sent over 2 desserts. We appreciated that they were able to comp the handrolls, brussel sprouts, and desserts for all the inconvenience. Once we received the check, the manager came over again to apologize for the wait and offered us a 15% service discount. We left the restaurant after paying.

I started feeling some stomach pains once we left the restaurant. I confided with my friend who I had ate with and she had also had slight stomach pains. On my drive home, I started to feel nauseous and knew it was definitely from something I had eaten. My friend later confided in me that she started feeling the same way around 4am. We felt horrible and found out that we both got food poisoning. We both concluded that it must have been something we had both eaten at the restaurant since we both had similar symptoms. We are both extremely disappointed in the whole experience given that Niku X holds such a high standard for food and experience.

This is the first time in my life I felt the need to write a bad review

We visited NIKU X for dinner and were deeply disappointed by the service. Despite their last call being at 10 PM, we arrived at 9:50 PM and were promptly informed that food orders needed to be placed before 10 PM. We quickly placed our order at 9:55 PM.

However, when we ordered our drinks, the bartender's attitude was less than welcoming. My partner, who is allergic to alcohol, ordered a non-alcoholic drink, while I ordered an alcoholic one. The bartender clearly did not want to make our drinks as they were preparing to close.

When our drinks were served, my partner's non-alcoholic drink contained alcohol. This could have been disastrous if we hadn't realized in time, especially considering my partner's allergy. Fortunately, we lived upstairs, but had she been the designated driver, this mistake could have put us in a very difficult situation.

After waiting for half an hour, the manager approached us to inform us that due to a miscommunication, the kitchen was unable to prepare our food. He offered to pay for our drinks and said he would see what leftovers were available in the kitchen to serve us. Offering leftovers after making us wait for half an hour is simply unacceptable. We were extremely hungry after being out all day, and they could have informed us much sooner so we could have found somewhere else to eat.

Overall, this experience was incredibly disappointing and potentially dangerous due to the mix-up with the drinks. We hope the management addresses these serious issues to prevent future incidents. Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Food: 1 Service: 1 Atmosphere: 2

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURMeGR2cEdnEAE,Natalie Lee,1 star,a year ago,"Today was the first time in a while where I realized I am ONLY an Asian living in LA.

From the moment me and my visiting friend sat down at the table, the waitress handed over menus with some sass.

Two of us ordered, one appetizer, four entrees, and two drinks, which came out to be $402.

Starting with the appetizer, food came out one at a time. One of the dishes we ordered was sashimi platter. After putting the dish on the table, explaining the platter, the waiter from the kitchen, accidentally touched/ poked the food. He tried to laugh off by saying “ahahahahh,… oh my gosh~~ I’m so sorryyyy~.” Then he walked away. It’s a lawsuit. The fact that he touched a raw fish then walked away laughing without even offering to bring out a fresh new plate was the first red flag.

And to continue with the sashimi, it was the worst sashimi I had in my life. Not only was it not fresh, the color, texture, the way it was sliced… the food was done at a level that could have been done by a teenager at home.

Then when entrees started coming out, the waitress came over to move around plates on the table to make some space. As she was doing so, she spilled a bowl of soy sauce on the table and into my wasabi bowl. The sauce nearly missed my white jacket. When I asked the waitress to wipe the soy sauce, she said she will get it wiped without even an apology.

Lastly the $180 kobe striploin was such a waste of money. 40% was fat, not even from marbling, but just excessive fat that should have been taken care of in the kitchen.

Out of five dishes we ordered, we only finished one, which was wagyu tartare. Wagyu fried rice, we didn’t even attempt to taste it as it looked like a microwaved frozen beef rice.

At last the manager came over to ask what was unsatisfying about the meal. When I told him everything including some other details not included in this review, he took the two plates of sashimi and the wagyu fried rice out from the check.

Simultaneously he gave me his business card saying the next time I make a visit he will provide special course menu + explained how some of their sashimis are dry aged, causing them to not “look” fresh. Listen, this isn’t my first day on this planet eating dry aged sashimi. The fact that the manager tried to cover up the whole unsettling experience with his story of dry aged sashimi shows he himself doesn’t have the basics down as for a manager.

It is very hard to believe that this restaurant is even on the Michelin guide. Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Price per person $100+ Food: 2 Service: 2 Atmosphere: 3 Recommended dishes

The cocktails and food were delicious. Our server Bella was so helpful in guiding our party through the special Father’s Day cocktail and Food menu. We asked her so many questions and she didn’t stress. She recommended the Hibiki Harmony Dry aged tomahawk and it was amazing!.

My guests were so grateful for this dinner experience. The cocktails and food were almost as  amazing as the hospitality that Bella and Taylor showed our group.  We will be back to try the regular menu because it looked so damn delicious.

Thank you Bella for making my Father’s Day dinner the best meal we’ve shared all year.

The atmosphere at the restaurant was lovely, but what truly made the night unforgettable was the exceptional service. The bar lead, a tall gentleman with a beard (sorry, I can't recall his name!), was incredibly knowledgeable and engaging.

His expertise went far beyond just drinks. He was passionate about the history of the menu items, especially the fascinating details  about how the meat was aged and prepared.  He also had an impressive understanding of mezcal and other beverages, making fantastic recommendations that perfectly complemented our meal.

Thanks to this exceptional staff member, my experience  was  unforgettable,  and I'm already planning my next visit.  If you're looking for a fantastic meal and exceptional service, this is the place to go! Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Price per person $50–100 Food: 5 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 5

Mike (our main server) did an amazing job making our experience extremely enjoyable and was very communicative, making this tasting all the better. The niku team asides also did a great job explaining everything and continually making tonight amazing.

I would definitely recommend those to try this tasting at least once. It's definitely a treat 😋

This restaurant is under the same brand as  Xpot so the meat quality is great and maintained their usual standard. Specializing in wagyu, all meat is fatty with that perfect marble. The pickles side dish is a great balance.

We ordered Prix fixe menu and get to enjoy different cuts. The portion is alright. For 2 of us, we weren’t really full after the meal so we ordered another tomahawk tasting menu. But this one we couldn’t finish it all.

Although the presentation is nice and interior design is fancy. I personally find it a bit overpriced. Some presentation is just for show and social media, I understand the marketing strategy but couldn’t appreciate it. It’s a good choice for celebration and events. They also have private dining space. But not so cost effective for day to day dining. Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Price per person $100+ Food: 3 Service: 4 Atmosphere: 4 Recommended dishes

The interior architecture is modern and elegant, while the decorations and food presentation compliment these themes. The staff are very kind, though one of them acted a bit informal. Our server was very friendly, which I love in a course meal, being able to chat with them during the experience. The only downside of the space is that the restaurant was playing upbeat music which was loud. It was a bit bothersome and was hard to hear the servers explaining each course.
Onto the food, I highly recommend the course meals because these are experiences designed from beginning to last and they give you a full experience. I chose the lower priced menu because the starters felt more appealing, and they definitely hit the spot. All the dishes throughout the night are very rich, overflowing with umami flavors from ingredients like truffle, Wagyu, and egg yolk. At the same time, the chefs at Niku X know to pair these fatty beef cuts with acidic garnishes like lemon and ume, which helps balance out the intensity. I can nitpick a few things, but that is after understanding that the whole meal was amazing. With the tenderloin, they present it on a small, soft slice of bread and this portion was hard to eat without it all falling apart. The sukiyaki had a whole shiso leaf with it to eat, and that was overbearing over the rest of the ingredients.
If you are looking for a premium dinner experience, definitely look to Niku X to be pampered with an incredibly enjoyable night. Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Price per person $100+ Food: 5 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 4 Recommended dishes

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNacUtpLWZREAE,Joshua Cruz,1 star,2023-01-01,"do you know how bad a place has to be in order for someone who has never submitted a review to feel compelled to write one up mere minutes after eating? you would think being on the michelin guide meant something. i have never felt more robbed by a restaurant.

let me try to paint a picture. we arrive for an 8PM reservation only to wait 20 minutes to be seated in a nowhere near full restaurant. i watch later parties be seated by the same staff that has walked by me multiple times. i have to ask the hostess if anyone planned to seat me, to her surprise.

at this point, you see the rolling robots that bring drinks and dishes to tables. it’s the kind of thing that feels cute in a small sushi joint, but feels tone-deaf in a giant upscale restaurant with tons of staff that is marketing a five-star experience.

i attempt to order sake to pair with this meal. no luck. this alleged high-end japanese wagyu joint is somehow out of nearly every sake on the list. the beverage director has to come to our table to recommend a bottle - as if they or i had a choice.

we came for the a la carte menu but decided to try the “premium” tasting menu thinking it’d be worth the price. we couldn’t have been more wrong.

for starters, why am i able to smell the bluefish tuna “crudu” (server’s words, not mine) and why does it taste fishy? the scallop was somehow cooked enough to develop a inedible outside layer. the caviar and potage are good but that in and of itself is very hard to mess up. there is no brine to the caviar and the popcorn added to the potage is gimmicky. amateur hour at a restaurant of this purported level.

you’ll learn that the staff is instructed to tell you where everything is from - australian this, african that. so much so that the kimchi persian cucumber is somehow from japan. you think you came to experience japanese barbecue only to be served banchan and pregrilled vegetables slathered in sauce.

we go through 3 rounds of grilled meat and every single one of them is tough, chewy, and flavorless. it is the last 3 meats they serve where you think “finally”… this is what you came for. the server will tell you to pick from your choice of ribeye, striploin, or kobe as your final course. he’ll fail to mention that the kobe is an extra charge added to your already extremely overpriced meal.

we asked for chocolate cake and cheesecake for the dessert, but instead we got lavender cake. in our server’s words “this is on us.” what generosity! can someone explain how that is possible on a pre fixe meal?

i have to laugh at this entire experience to keep from feeling completely taken for a fool. absolutely nothing about this place is premium. save yourself the time and money by dining elsewhere. anywhere in sawtelle or koreatown runs laps around this overhyped and overpriced restaurant. when multiple servers pronounce wagyu as “wa-goo”, run.

From the moment we entered the restaurant, we were welcomed by a warm and luxurious atmosphere that promised a truly high-end dining experience.

One of the most impressive aspects of NIKU X is their extraordinary use of ingredients. Their signature dish, which combines the finest wayu beef with an innovative blend of caviar, is nothing short of a culinary masterpiece. The fusion of flavors and textures was a delightful surprise that left our taste buds dancing with excitement.

Now, let me tell you about our server, Robert. His exceptional service was the cherry on top of an already perfect evening. Robert's professionalism and expertise were evident from the moment he introduced himself to us. He guided us through each course with meticulous explanations and cooking demonstrations that showcased his extensive knowledge and passion for the cuisine. It was an interactive and educational experience that made the meal even more enjoyable.

Robert's attentive and personable demeanor made us feel like VIP guests. He managed to strike the perfect balance between being available for our needs and giving us space to enjoy our meal. We truly appreciated his genuine enthusiasm and warmth, which only added to the overall charm of NIKU X.

In conclusion, I wholeheartedly give NIKU X and our server Robert a well-deserved five-star rating. Their unparalleled culinary creations, coupled with Robert's exceptional service, made for a dining experience that will forever be etched in our memories. If you're looking for a high-end dining experience that will transport your senses to new heights, look no further than NIKU X in downtown LA. We can't wait to return!

It was an awesome experience. Will def be back for the tomahawk experience as we did a la carte from having a lengthy food tour earlier in the day. We ordered essentially small plates to try and touch and go on different parts of the menu.

Got some wagyu tallow potato pave. That dipping sauce is incredible. Caviar, uni tartare is definitely a greatest hit for them, must order item. Ocean plate added a nice twist despite it being wagyu-centric resto. The fish, scallop and clam tasted fresh and that beurre blank is citrusy and on point. Roasted bone marrow is a nice visual with them lighting it on fire tableside. Definitely order this one per person. Rich and unctuous, so good. Would love to have brought it home for my dog, but im from SF. The wagyu donabe reminded me of bibimbap, would be dope if yall had a sizzling stone pot version!

They were out of a brand of whiskey and vodka they had on their menu which was disappointing. . When it came down to ordering food, whatever we wanted to order from the steak menu was not available since we had to order that in advance. We were unaware of this. I didn’t get a call from the restaurant to let me know how their menu works. We ordered tuna tartare and it was never brought to our table and we were charged twice for it somehow. Ordered another dish that the waitress didn’t bring and when we asked for it, she said I’m sorry it was my bad I’ve been busy running around, she came back and said I’m sorry we don’t have that item right now. For a restaurant to call themselves 5 star it was very disappointing to experience all of this issues. I've never experienced going to a restaurant and not being able to order food off of their menu. Paid $800 for whatever we had ordered just to end up at Mastro’s which was two blocks away and you won’t leave there hungry. Sad part is that not a single member of management came to our table to even apologize or acknowledge how bad their service was",[]

I came with my friends to try the set menu and steak here, and the service was very nice, with a waiter to introduce each dish and recommend how to eat it. Especially the A5 Wagyu beef dishes as the main course are very delicious. I recommend making a reservation to try the 45-day dry-aged Fullblood Tomahawk steak, which I feel is the best steak I've tasted so far. Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Price per person $100+

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSNDVyU2hnRRAB,Arash Zakikhani,2 stars,2023-01-01,"I headed they had been added to the Michelin guide, and I love Wagyu, so  I was excited to try their food. Unfortunately, the place was Beyond Overrated! We tried the 14-course menu, and some pieces were okay, but nothing was great. Their Wagyu A4 was their best piece (really good). Although, for an unusual reason, they added Blueberry sauce to their A5, which DESTROYED the meat's taste. It reminded me of a blueberry pancake. Such a waste of good meat.

The drinks were all right, and we liked them. Ambiance 3 stars (it wasn't bad, nothing unique. they had some artwork on a wall), service 1 star (empty glasses of water, multiple dishes on the table, I don't even want to start with napkins and everything else), Value 1 star (it would be acceptable for around $150-$200 not for $400). Overall, 2,3 stars for a high-end restaurant.

Btw if you are a vegetarian, don't get close to that place. They were dishonest about their offering (really disappointing). They charged the same price of $300ish ($400 with drinks/tip) for their veggie option (which wasn't even 5,6 courses compared to 14), and it was the worst veggie we had ever tried in any place in LA. We go to restaurants a lot. Most have been honest about their offering, for example, Mélisse Restaurant, 2 Michelin stars; when I called them, they said they were sorry but couldn't accommodate Vegetarians, and I appreciated their honesty. They didn't try to rob us.

Should you go? If you have been to all high-end restaurants in LA, including Michelin restaurants (because that is what you are paying), and a lack of quality, service, and details doesn't bother you much, you can try this too.

I pay $400, sometimes even more, in many restaurants (including 3-star Michelin worldwide), and I am okay with spending that money for experience and greatness. Not because I have too much money to burn, which I don't. I had great experiences (and also some disappointing ones) throughout my journey. This restaurant was one of my worst experiences in any high-end restaurant (above the $250 range). Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Price per person $100+

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNSM1pQNDNnRRAB,Ashley Tran,2 stars,2023-01-01,"Went here last night for my birthday dinner. Dinner came out to $650 for the two of us and at that price point, service should be top tier. It wasn’t. I’m surprised Chef Shin Thompson held a previous Michelin Star & overlooked the service. I never write reviews but last night’s service really pains me.

Service: Generous 1/5

1. Our menus when we sat down were bent and dirty (they’re printed on cardstock I’ve bought at Michael’s). The courses also don’t follow the order of what comes out which was confusing
2. They don’t have purse or coat hooks so i was already like huh?? My purse fell on the floor & our jackets fell like 3x
3. Food Pacing- they dropped 4 dishes at once so by the time it was time for our soup, it was barely luke warm. Also, why don’t they have soup spoons? It was SO HARD to drink the soup. Bevel was so wide you couldn’t sip from the bowl.
4. They never changed our utensils. I had to ask constantly & they often left me without a knife … at a yakiniku restaurant. Also, I’m not going to slice into a beautiful cut of beef with a knife covered in fish juices or blueberry jam?
5. They put the scallop onto a plate with trash on it hahahah (leftover lemon from the dish prior)
6. When our server opened the box for the beef she walked away without even explaining what was what. I had to ask someone else walking by. This blew my mind & I have video of it. I spent majority of my dinner listening to the server at the table next to us. He did a much better job. Overheard him saying the $10 upcharge for the A5 ribeye would be a hotpot and I was like … huh, how was that never mentioned to us?
7. They didn’t even refill my water. I pushed my glass out as far as possible & couldn’t refill my own water unless I got up from my seat. Lastly, at the end of dinner they ignored my empty glass and grabbed the check right next to it. I was fuming. REFILL WATER. PLEASE. We paid $9 and we weren’t offered “house” aka tap.

Food reviews:

Seafood: 2/5
Half the tasting menu was seafood (this surprised me). Majority of the seafood didn’t taste very clean, maybe I’m too spoiled having gone to places like n/naka. The scallop with uni butter would be a 5/5- that item saved the night.

Meats: 4/5
Maybe closer to a 3.5? We’ll round up because the sauces were amazing. Good meats should be able to stand alone though- I’m not sure these would have. Most of the pieces were melty but still very chewy (cartilage/muscle). I wish we’d gone to a butcher and picked up an A5 Ribeye to make at home.

At least they brought out a happy birthday sign on my dessert. Don’t be like me and fall for the IG ads … Props to their marketing team.

What an experience, from the moment we walked to the place we felt that we are at the finest restaurant in Japan.
Beautiful and open kitchen, where you can see your dish being prepared very attentively.
Our server did a great job explaining every elegant dish we were served throughout our experience. Thank you Chaeho for making this visit a memorable one.
From the lobster, uni, to the wagyu beef, to the exceptional desserts. Every bites was an experience by itself. Can’t wait to comeback and try the tomahawk steak.
Every dish was carefully prepared and presented in a special way, Best yakiniku spot hands down.

Our anniversary felt like a real celebration thanks to you guys. Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Price per person $100+

Each table and booth felt cozy and private and it is such a great vibe for a date night or friends night out. The service was perfect too! Our waiter Wes made great conversation and took great care of us.

We did the tasting menu and each dish/course really blew our mind. All the meats were juicy and tender and had amazing flavor to it whether is was pre marinated or we dipped in their special sauce. The presentation of all the foods was on point and I loved all the palette cleansers they brought out in between.

The ending with the donabe was perfect and the dessert really helped tie the whole tasting experience together.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoMmRIQmdBRRAB,Rachel A Kroll,4 stars,2023-01-01,"This was my first time ever eating at a Michelin-rated restaurant! My boyfriend and I had an amazing experience! We made a reservation a week in advance and were seated promptly by the window with a great view.

We ordered only from the A La Carte menu because we wanted to have more control over our dining experience.

Started off with the Oxtail & Wagyu Potstickers and the Wagyu Tartare. The potstickers were tasty and had a lot of savory/umami/citrus notes. The tartare was a completely new experience for both of us as we'd never eaten raw beef before. It was seasoned really well and the texture wasn't off putting. Quail egg was a great touch.

Next we were served our choices of meat: Masami Outside Skirt Wagyu, Miyazaki Tri Tip, and Stone Axe Short Rib. The wagyu was melt-in-your-mouth delicious and a favorite for both of us. The other two cuts were slightly more tough to chew, but sooo flavorful and buttery. The server gave us pairing recommendations for the condiments & meat.

The star of the show was truly the Dry Aged Masami Strip Loin. We got an 8 oz. portion instead of 6 oz. due to our order being put in incorrectly. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare!

Finally ended our dinner with the Wagyu Fried Rice. This was tasty and had flavor components that a traditional fried rice wouldn't have. Lots of citrus notes and the egg presentation was beautiful. The wagyu bits were cut up so tiny though, it made me forget there was wagyu in the dish at all.

Lastly, they treated us to two complimentary desserts! We got the matcha pillow and the crème brûlée. The matcha pillow is just matcha ice cream, but I could tell the matcha quality was very good. The crème brûlée wasn't anything special but it was good!

I'm subtracting 1-star because I do think they're still getting into the swing of things, as they haven't officially had a grand opening yet. For first timers, I think there could have been a bit more assistance with explaining the menu beforehand - we had to ask the waiter for recommendations! The format of the meat grilling felt a little awkward at times because the server was just standing there watching us eat. And as I mentioned earlier, there was a misunderstanding with the order, so the strip loin and fried rice weren't put in until we asked about it later. We fortunately didn't have to pay for parking because we didn't drive, but I do think the $16.50 fee for parking valet is a bit ridiculous for how much you're paying to eat. Overall though this made for a perfect date night and our waiter Meng was fantastic! I really appreciated when he brought out the strip loin and he told us to start video recording because the steak reveal was so grand! Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Price per person $100+

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNodnVtY0RnEAE,Stephen Metzger,5 stars,2023-01-01,"Niku X is the premier date spot and dinner experience. I can't recommend it enough. I took my girlfriend here as a part of a larger anniversary weekend and we both thoroughly enjoyed our experience. We both are already wanting to go back!

We did the tasting menu, which was coursed out over 2 hours or so. Additionally, we ordered some a la carte items and drinks (they now have their liquor license, which I had seen some recent reviews saying they didn't yet).

Food:

The first course was sashimi, which was actually one of favorites. The fish was so fresh and it had some jelly on top, which added a next level of flavor to the dish. We then were served our a la carte items, which were the wagyu bone marrow and 1000 layer potato. The wagyu bone marrow is a must! The bread alone is worth it, but the bone marrow itself is the best I have had.

The caviar, uni, and wagyu dish seems excessive from the extent that it is so many luxury items together in one dish, though it is amazing. It genuinely tastes like something out of this world. The uni was so fresh and the caviar was the perfect balance of flavor and saltiness. Together with the side items that are served with the dish, it is complemented really well.

The wagyu tray of various cuts of meats is the star of the show, both according to visuals and taste. The cuts of meat are all cooked and served by the waitstaff, which are explained in detail. Each piece was somehow better than the last.

the final course of a5 wagyu on toast with blueberry jam and foie gras, was good, but I think ti could have been a little better. I think the flavors complemented each other very well, but knowing how a5 tastes by itself, it made me wanting more out of the dish a little. I wanted to taste the richness of the meat and I though that was lacking from the dish. The dish itself was great, but it felt like deep down I was missing something, since I know all of the ingredients separately.

Drinks:

The Matcha Colada was great, especially if you like matcha. It was fresh matcha and definitely blended well with the coconut. I would recommend it for matcha lovers.

The margarita was probably one of the best margaritas that I have had ANYWHERE in LA. It was that good. Definitely a 10/10 for me.

Ume Raba was good, but my 3rd ranked from the bunch. It was refereshing, but not really my style.

As a bonus, they serve oolong tea as a palette cleanser mid-meal, which was great. I will unashamedly admit I had 4 cups of tea.

Dessert:

Matcha dessert was super rich, but delicious. I liked it a lot. It was similar to a matcha ice cream, with powdered matcha around it. My girlfriend thought the matcha flavor was too rich, though I thought it was perfect.

The creme brûlée was the better of the two dishes as was the textbook definition of an ideal dessert in my opinion. Only only downside is that it is pretty small.

Service:

Service was tip tier, like you would find in a Michelin restaurant. The servers were knowledgeable and friendly, especially about the dishes and what they were preparing for us.

Overall:

The food was all top tier and I have no doubt that this place will receive a Michelin Star in the near future. If someone asked me what I wanted to eat every day for the rest of my life, it would be this place. I would happily do so.

I now dream to do the tomahawk experience next. Hopefully sometime soon. Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Price per person $100+ Parking Valet parking at the Interncontinental hotel, which came out to $16.50

While the staff seemed a little nervous at times, I could tell it was from their desire to make sure all was presented perfectly & things came from kitchen to table in a timely fashion. I have to say: from the consommé’s deep umami broth, the brightness of their lobster sashimi, the grandiose delivery & table-side grilling of the fresh trout & ALL the incredible meats from Australia, US & Japan, I’m very happy I came.

The moment you walk through their doors you are immediately greeted with a view of an immense kitchen, curated by Michelin Star Chef Shin Thompson. You can watch your meal being carefully prepared. It’s stunning.

Our fantastic waiter Chaeho did a phenomenal job presenting each elegant dish and conversing with us throughout our meal. We felt at home with his personal stories and interesting insights. Our superb assistant waitress, Phoebe, who helped bring out some of the dishes was very professional and sweet. The entire staff at this restaurant are top quality professionals.

Our first course, crudo, was very fresh and a perfect start to our meal. The astrea oscietra caviar, paired with senbei cracker and topped with gold leaf was astounding and a treat to the taste buds. I have never had such a beautiful visual as well as sensory moment. There was no heaviness, only pleasure with each bite. The black winter truffle was presented in a Louis Vuitton mini suitcase, and shaved onto the meat. Now I know what it feels like to be presented with an award!

The style and story behind each plate reflected the precision and passion of the kitchen. It’s obvious that the staff love what they do. I felt as though I was in an edible art gallery; the balance of texture and color was so artistic.

My favorite dish was the wagu platter, not just for the breathtaking display, but each cut of meat touched my tongue with intense flavor. To continue the journey, every course had a different palate cleanser with its own sensation.

The price is worth the entire experience. It is very special and one of a kind unique. I recommend it for an exceptional date night, or a gathering. I will never forget it. Service Dine in Meal type Dinner Price per person $100+

Located on the 2nd floor of the Intercontinental hotel. You won't get lost, there's a bunch of signs telling you where to go via escalator or elevator.

We got the Yakiniku Tasting Menu which includes appetizers, yakiniku, and dessert. Every dish was very decadent and umami from start to finish -- the uni, caviar and wagyu tartare dish to the different types of wagyu from the US, Australia, and Japan. You'll leave wanting more of the toriyama sandwich with foie gras and milk bread.

Besides the food, the vibe and the service by Mama J was phenomenal - she was funny and also attentive to make our experience one-of-a-kind. Thanks again for the lovely service and delicious food.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURCektheVVBEAE,Loya Langston,5 stars,2023-01-01,"What an experience!!! Had the pleasure of enjoying the tasting menu at Niku X. The menu items were curated nicely. We were greeted with welcoming smiles and seated promptly even thought we arrived a little early for our reservation. The staff was very accommodating and informative of the experience, menu items and aging process of the meat. The way the staff moved around and made things happen felt so ""top secret"" and movie-like.. I absolutely loved the vibe.
The food was literally works of art presented on platters. Just picture perfect and indulgent at the same time. The food was wonderful, rich and again a well planned adventure. I LOVE that some of our humongous (and delicious) steak was used to prepare our fried rice later in the meal. Some of my favorite dishes were the salad, oxtail wontons, 16 layer potato stack and the Bone marrow. (That's like everything lol)
Oh and PLEASE slather your steak in the egg sauce ... AH-mazing!! (I poured a bit over my fried rice too)
If you are up for a foodie adventure, definitely visit Niku X.  Perfect for a special occasion as well!
There were other items I wanted to try on the menu but the portions on the tasting menu were perfectly filling.
I Will definitely return sooner than later cause I had my eye on the Uni caviar dish!

It was very modern, Japanese inspired. Next, our overall experience and our waiter Julie C. was amazing. Julie was not only very knowledgeable about all the meats and seafood, but she was so funny and such a delight. She helped move the meal along in a very fun and entertaining way.

My boyfriend and I tried their tasting menu and everything blew our minds. We were told the menu has changed like 10 times since they opened, but the one we had was amazing. All the appetizers were pristine. The Crudo Sashimi with Waygu, Bluefin Tuna and Fish Belly with a Shoyu Creme Fraiche just melted in our mouths. And the Caviar with Uni and Wagyu Tartare was unreal. The Consomme with a Waygu bone broth that takes 2 days to make served with Dungeness Crab was incredible. But my favorite appetizer was the Lobster Sashimi, it was so fresh and insanely good.

The grilled items were the stars of the show. Everything from Lobster tail with Uni Butter, to a 7 day dry aged Salmon, to a variety of the highest quality meats from around the world and  served on the most beautiful platters. Honestly, 10/10 for presentation and for their dishware. Very unique and beautiful pieces that remind me of Japan.

All the meats were cooked to perfection and each were paired with sauces or were perfectly tasty on their own. The Yakiniku sauce is a must-have, I dipped all my meat in that.
