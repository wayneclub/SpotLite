Food (everything I ordered) was tasty, good portion (one item fills you up), reasonably price, prepared pretty quick (within 15 min, meal was served for all 5 people). They went above & beyond to fill our need & served every request with grace. They even offered complimentary rice & salad. Very appreciative of the chef as well as the server.

Food Quality
- Ordered Chicken Karahi, but it had a bad smell, making it unpleasant to eat.
- Requested green chili, but was given only a tiny quarter-sized piece after a long wait.

Customer Service
- The employee's attitude was unprofessional, creating a poor impression.
- Slow service and lack of attention to customer requests.

Guest Experience
- Brought my guest expecting a good meal, but one of them experienced vomiting afterward.
- Felt mistreated, especially as someone from India/Nepal, making the visit uncomfortable.

Final Verdict
Based on this visit, I **do not recommend** this restaurant, especially for South Asian guests, as the overall experience was disappointing. Service Dine in Price per person $30–50 Food: 1 Service: 1 Atmosphere: 1 Wait time 10-30 min

Replied to owners reply : first try to be professional you cant say dont come back to customer just because we made you realise how deep is your restaurant. Try to focus on improving, instead of losing a customer. Literally your food sucks. Rice was like a chewing plastic and thats the fact. I guess we expected more from a nepali restaurant. Dont give the bad quality food and spoil the image of Nepali thali for saving few bucks. I suggest you try some nepali food from texas DFW and get inspired. Aba ofcourse khana nai 5-6 chamchi jati diyesi 3-4 choti thapi halxa ni. Good luck never coming again.

Re reply: Nothing to say, afno image ra customer interaction kasto cha vanera afai public platform ma proof garirakhnu vayeko cha. Feri pani not only me jo koi pani ekchoti tya gayesi they never gonna come back dont worry.  With due respect,
Just wanna say again, please dont ruin the image of Nepali Thali in foreign land to save few bucks 😭 Service Dine in Food: 1 Service: 4 Atmosphere: 3

We ordered the chicken fried rice, chicken tikka masala, and garlic naan - they were all scrumptious and hit the spot. I asked for medium level spiciness and they nailed it. The garlic naan is made in house, from scratch and it was the most delicious garlic naan (or any naan for that matter) I've ever had. The service is great too. I wish they'd get more customers because they deserve it. Service Dine in Meal type Lunch Price per person $20–30 Food: 5 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 5 Recommended dishes Garlic Naan, Chicken Tikka
