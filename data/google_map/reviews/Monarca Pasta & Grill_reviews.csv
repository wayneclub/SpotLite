Highlights:
- Hawaiian pizza was very good and I’m sure their other pizzas would be equally good too because their pizza crust taste perfect & the amount of cheese & sauce used are the right amounts.
- Chicken black sauce pasta is the bomb. 1 of the tastiest pastas I’ve had and the you’d want more the more you eat it. Highly recommended 👍 Food: 5 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 3
