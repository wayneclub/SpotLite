    "text": "If you love spicy food, this place is a must-try! YGF Malatang serves real, authentic Asian-style spicy hot pot that’s super popular among young Asians. If you’re not afraid of heat and want to see what’s trending in Asia’s street food scene, this is the spot.\nYou’ll often see groups of young girls ordering tons of meat and laughing over steaming bowls of malatang — it’s such a fun vibe. The food is priced by weight ($14.99/lb), and they even deduct the bowl’s weight before weighing, which makes it super fair. The soup base is free, and the staff are friendly and efficient.\nFor reference, if you cook at home, slices of meat usually costs around $4–8/lb, so the price here is reasonable. I usually spend about $20 for a full meal, including a bowl of rice (only $1 and refillable!). Plus, there’s no mandatory tip, which is great for anyone who eats out often.\nIf you want to experience how young Asians enjoy spicy food culture — and you can handle the heat — this is definitely the place to go! 🔥 Food: 5 Service: 4 Atmosphere: 3\n\nFood: 5\nService: 4\nAtmosphere: 3"

The food itself was delicious, but unfortunately, after eating I experienced stomach problems, which was very disappointing.\n\nIn addition, I had a very unpleasant interaction with one of your staff members. On Wednesday around 10 PM, a male staff member (a bit heavyset and wearing glasses) spoke to me very rudely. He told me to clear my own dishes, raising his voice in a very impolite manner. We don’t mind to do it but we did not know that customers were expected to clear their own dishes, as there was no sign indicating this policy."

    "text": "If there was a YGF wall of fame I would be on it. My friend and I have been coming here weekly for the better part of 6 months. YGF used to be great...roll up into the worst parking lot in Los Angeles, squeak by the hammered cybertruck, and go inside the warmly lit restaurant, lose a couple decibels of hearing from the Chinese EDM...it was all the better because of the contrast between exterior (ravaged) and interior (pleasantly smashed). Some time ago this place has become overrun. I don't know when word got out (probably because of all of you writing these reviews about how this is the best YGF in the area...not anymore...) but now all of Los Angeles under the age of 35 is here. Last week we couldn't even get a seat, and there was a haphazard line spinning itself into the main cavity of the restaurant. The whole place is about 50 square feet, so really there was no line, just an abscess of people in the center of the restaurant. You couldn't even navigate to the food bar. The staff, bless them, had no idea how to handle the crowd. Waiting system? The cashier told me to just fight it out for myself. The competition was too fierce; I was out-girlbossed. YGF I know  you're trying to be the next HDL but if you wanted that to happen for yourself you would read a management book and play it more like Diner Dash. PLEASE. It's the Asian Century...I dunno if I'm gonna make it there... Food: 5 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 1\n\nFood: 5\nService: 5\nAtmosphere: 1"

The flavor really immerses in the food (that’s very important because some other location when I order it dried the flavor doesn’t come with it.

But when they cooked it and I ate it, there was a lot less meat, and other things, they basically stole them and didn't put them in. There was only one lotus root, which also meant that they stole my ingredients when they were cooking in the kitchen, which is to cut corners and cheat customers. The boss is a wicked person. I have lived in the United States for so long and I have seen it again. Everyone must be careful when you go to eat in the future. Check whether the things you ordered are in there. They will definitely have your ingredients that they won't put in. I will never go there again. The boss cheats customers. I see this place often makes such things. It is like stealing our things.
