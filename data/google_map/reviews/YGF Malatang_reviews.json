      "raw_text": "We were feeling hungry after an expo in the area and we saw this nearby so decided to give it a go since we've been to similar places and knew it would be self/fast service. They have a small lot but there was parking and it was free in downtown which is hard to come by. Self service like other establishments of this type. Just grab a bowl and tongs and pick out the ingredients you want to eat and got it weighed, picked a flavor of broth or spice blend, paid and grabbed a seat. Made our own sauces and within 10 minutes we had our soupy mix ready to eat.\n\nFlavors were good and the meat variety was plenty and tables cleaned. What more could I ask for in a hungry state. The atmosphere reminded me of a fast paced chinese dining hall in china where service isn't really a thing. It's great for a college or busy work schedule life style when you need to grab food quickly. Even leftovers which you can take with you is self service, just grab the plastic container and bag and off we went after eating.\n\nService: Dine in\nFood: 4",

      "raw_text": "If you love spicy food, this place is a must-try! YGF Malatang serves real, authentic Asian-style spicy hot pot that’s super popular among young Asians. If you’re not afraid of heat and want to see what’s trending in Asia’s street food scene, this is the spot.\nYou’ll often see groups of young girls ordering tons of meat and laughing over steaming bowls of malatang — it’s such a fun vibe. The food is priced by weight ($14.99/lb), and they even deduct the bowl’s weight before weighing, which makes it super fair. The soup base is free, and the staff are friendly and efficient.\nFor reference, if you cook at home, slices of meat usually costs around $4–8/lb, so the price here is reasonable. I usually spend about $20 for a full meal, including a bowl of rice (only $1 and refillable!). Plus, there’s no mandatory tip, which is great for anyone who eats out often.\nIf you want to experience how young Asians enjoy spicy food culture — and you can handle the heat — this is definitely the place to go! 🔥\n\nFood: 5\nService: 4\nAtmosphere: 3",

Last week we couldn't even get a seat, and there was a haphazard line spinning itself into the main cavity of the restaurant. The whole place is about 50 square feet, so really there was no line, just an abscess of people in the center of the restaurant. You couldn't even navigate to the food bar. The staff, bless them, had no idea how to handle the crowd. Waiting system? The cashier told me to just fight it out for myself. The competition was too fierce; I was out-girlbossed. YGF I know  you're trying to be the next HDL but if you wanted that to happen for yourself you would read a management book and play it more like Diner Dash. PLEASE. It's the Asian Century...I dunno if I'm gonna make it there...",
