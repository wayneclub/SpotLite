I ordered the Spicy Chicken sandwich, which had herb-roasted chicken breast, tomatoes, house slaw, provolone & sweet chili sauce, and the Peanut Kale salad, which had fresh herbs, serrano, roasted peanut vinaigrette & grated reggiano. Everything was so fresh and delicious, especially the bread on the sandwich!!!! I appreciated that they had plenty of vegan options for my vegan friend, and can’t wait to come back and try other ones.\n\nThe line was worth the wait, and it wasn’t terribly bad. Went fairly quickly for a weekend crowd and food came out fast.

      "raw_text": "Cafe Dulce at USC Village is a gem that stands out for its pretty good and unique pastries and drinks. This cafe has become a popular spot for students and visitors, offering a delightful array of treats and beverages that cater to diverse tastes.\n\nOne of the highlights of Cafe Dulce is their green tea donut, which features a rich matcha flavor that is both unique and satisfying1. Another favorite is the apple pie donut, combining the comforting flavors of apple pie with the convenience of a donut1. These pastries are not only delicious but also beautifully presented, making them a feast for both the eyes and the taste buds.\n\nIn addition to their pastries, Cafe Dulce offers a variety of drinks that perfectly complement their baked goods. The matcha latte and rose latte are highly recommended, providing a refreshing and flavorful experience1.
