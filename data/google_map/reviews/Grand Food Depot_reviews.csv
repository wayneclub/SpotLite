The chicken wasn't even tenders like I ordered and were some reheated old stale chicken that was hard as a rock. Then the waffle was dryey than the dessert.

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNUc0pqQ2hRRRAB,Marai Jimenez,5 stars,a year ago,"I recently had the pleasure of eating at Healthy Organic Catering and indulged in their Grilled Chicken Pesto Sandwich and Turkey Club. The experience was nothing short of delightful.

The Grilled Chicken Pesto Sandwich was a burst of flavors with its fresh basil pesto, ripe tomatoes, and juice tender chicken, all nestled between perfectly toasted bread. Each bite was a harmonious blend of savory and herbaceous notes, leaving me craving more.

The Turkey Club was a classic favorite done right. The tender slices of turkey paired beautifully with crispy bacon, fresh lettuce, and juicy tomatoes, all held together by soft, toasted bread. The combination of textures and flavors made this sandwich a true standout.

Overall, my experience at Healthy Organic Catering was exceptional. The use of fresh, organic ingredients shone through in every bite, and the attention to detail in the preparation of each dish was evident. I highly recommend trying the Pesto Sandwich and Turkey Club for a satisfying and delicious meal.

If you're a walk up, orders take longer than advertised. You may not receive the text your order is ready, so you have to check with them to see if your food is just sitting there getting cold.

There's a one lane, one way driveway so if you have multiple people in your car ordering from different places, you'll want to walk up to each window so you don't have to drive around the block to get back in the driveway waiting for your friend's order to be ready

I think the only way this place is worth it is to order ahead for pick up. Service Take out Meal type Dinner Price per person $10–20 Food: 3 Service: 2 Atmosphere: 2 Recommendation for vegetarians Somewhat recommend

there are several vendors at this location, as it's more geared towards the food delivery services than the walk up customers.

i ordered a pastrami philly cheesesteak sandwich, and the pastrami was very tasty. the sliced steak seemed a little over seasoned but was still good. would recommend trying one of the cheeses versus their cheese whiz, just as a balance for their version. both meats were very juicy and tender though, as the bread was soaking it up.

the size was good, so portion wise was excellent. I'll add this to my list to try the other sandwiches here. i just need to try the other menus at this location first. Service Take out Meal type Lunch Price per person $10–20 Food: 4 Service: 4 Atmosphere: 3
