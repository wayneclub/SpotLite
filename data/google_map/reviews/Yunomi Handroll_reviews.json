The fried shrimp appetizer was another highlight: crispy, hot, and perfectly seasoned. Service at the counter was fast and efficient once we were seated, and the food came out quickly.\n\nUnfortunately, getting to that point was a whole ordeal. Parking was a nightmare, and once we arrived, there was a wait to be seated despite I got waitlisted 45 minutes ago. Once seated, we found the seating to be very uncomfortable—tight spacing, stiff stools, and a general lack of comfort that made it hard to settle in and enjoy the meal. For a place where you’re meant to sit and eat rolls fresh as they come out, the setup felt rushed and cramped.\n\nBottom line: Yunomi has some tasty menu items, particularly the Unagi and fried shrimp, and the kitchen moves fast—but the logistics and environment make it hard to recommend, especially on a busy weekend.

Given the importance of my request and the caliber of the restaurant, one would assume that more care would be taken and I left feeling ignored.

Ambiance is great.\n\nYunomi has a small-ish space in side because the seats are along the bar around the kitchen where they make drinks and hand rolls. They have two bathrooms in the back, but the hand washing station is outside the bathrooms. My party of three had to wait about 10-15 minutes even on a week day night.\n\nI personally had five hand rolls and still wasn't completely full. The guy who greeted us when we got seated knew it was our first time there, but he said nothing except the menu is obtained by scanning the QR code on the table. It was good thing I checked out the menu from photos posted online because he came back really quickly to take our orders.\n\nI think the hand roll sets are a cool way to try different fish, but the blue crab and negi toro and unagi are probably the better ones to try. They're more expensive - the negi toro is $11 lol.\n\nThere's free parking in the streets, but it took me 30 minutes to finally find a spot and I still had to walk 7 minutes to the restaurant. At least you can get Salt & Straw for dessert across the street.\n\nService: Dine in\nMeal type: Dinner\nPrice per person: $30–50\nFood: 4\nService: 4\nAtmosphere: 4",

The menu is deceptive with how simple and clean it is, but the ingredients are all top tier and everything they do, they do well. There is also a wonderful selection of Japanese beverages (beer, sake, etc)\n\nDon't leave without trying one of their house specials (either the yunomi handroll, or the albacore truffle crispy rice).\n\nA note for the managers, purse hooks installed under the bar would have made my experience much better, worrying about my purse falling off the foot rail did take away from my experience a bit.",
