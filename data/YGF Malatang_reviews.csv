The location is a few stops on Dash F. The food is as good as other YGF. It's priced by lbs. The stock is full when I went. They always restock the ingredients. The restaurant is a bit small but it's packed with seatings. It's self-service. Very delicious! Price per person $10–20 Food: 5 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 5 Wait time No wait

You don't order!

You pick up a clear bowl and metal tongs:
Full your bowl with all the veggies, herbs, and meats of your liking.
They have more than 50 items to select from.

3 different noodle types, mushrooms. . .

Then you take your bowl to weight in (15.99/ Lb.) select a broth type (4 types).

I suggest to choose the beef broth, medium spicy.

After you get your stuff cooked, then you go make your source, add some garnishes.

Garnishes:
Garlic,
Soy sauce
Chili oil. . .
10+ items

Have fun making your own Korean ramen bowl!!! 🔥 Price per person $10–20 Food: 5 Service: 5 Atmosphere: 5 Noise level Moderate noise Group size 1 person, 2 people, 3-4 people Wait time Up to 10 min Recommendation for vegetarians Somewhat recommend

YGF Malatang serves real, authentic Asian-style spicy hot pot that’s super popular among young Asians. If you’re not afraid of heat and want to see what’s trending in Asia’s street food scene, this is the spot.
You’ll often see groups of young girls ordering tons of meat and laughing over steaming bowls of malatang — it’s such a fun vibe. The food is priced by weight ($14.99/lb), and they even deduct the bowl’s weight before weighing, which makes it super fair. The soup base is free, and the staff are friendly and efficient.
For reference, if you cook at home, slices of meat usually costs around $4–8/lb, so the price here is reasonable. I usually spend about $20 for a full meal, including a bowl of rice (only $1 and refillable!). Plus, there’s no mandatory tip, which is great for anyone who eats out often.
If you want to experience how young Asians enjoy spicy food culture — and you can handle the heat — this is definitely the place to go! 🔥 Food: 5 Service: 4 Atmosphere: 3

The food is good and the service is decent, and the atmosphere is nice. However, the main issue is that items are often missing from my dish. After paying by food weight, it seems that some items are taken out before the dish is served.

The food itself was delicious, but unfortunately, after eating I experienced stomach problems, which was very disappointing.

In addition, I had a very unpleasant interaction with one of your staff members. On Wednesday around 10 PM, a male staff member (a bit heavyset and wearing glasses) spoke to me very rudely. He told me to clear my own dishes, raising his voice in a very impolite manner. We don’t mind to do it but we did not know that customers were expected to clear their own dishes, as there was no sign indicating this policy."

YGF used to be great...roll up into the worst parking lot in Los Angeles, squeak by the hammered cybertruck, and go inside the warmly lit restaurant, lose a couple decibels of hearing from the Chinese EDM...it was all the better because of the contrast between exterior (ravaged) and interior (pleasantly smashed). Some time ago this place has become overrun. I don't know when word got out (probably because of all of you writing these reviews about how this is the best YGF in the area...not anymore...) but now all of Los Angeles under the age of 35 is here. Last week we couldn't even get a seat, and there was a haphazard line spinning itself into the main cavity of the restaurant. The whole place is about 50 square feet, so really there was no line, just an abscess of people in the center of the restaurant. You couldn't even navigate to the food bar. The staff, bless them, had no idea how to handle the crowd. Waiting system? The cashier told me to just fight it out for myself. The competition was too fierce; I was out-girlbossed. YGF I know  you're trying to be the next HDL but if you wanted that to happen for yourself you would read a management book and play it more like Diner Dash. PLEASE.

My Orders was ready for a whole ten minutes but the server refused to give me my food  as they prioritized finishing door dash orders over in person orders.

The food was very numbing as it didn't really taste like anything but made my tongue numb, it was hard to eat so I wasn't able to finish it but was able to try a little bit of everything, which the meats werent very flavorful and were all mostly frozen.

But when they cooked it and I ate it, there was a lot less meat, and other things, they basically stole them and didn't put them in. There was only one lotus root, which also meant that they stole my ingredients when they were cooking in the kitchen, which is to cut corners and cheat customers. The boss is a wicked person. I have lived in the United States for so long and I have seen it again. Everyone must be careful when you go to eat in the future. Check whether the things you ordered are in there. They will definitely have your ingredients that they won't put in. I will never go there again. The boss cheats customers. I see this place often makes such things. It is like stealing our things.

How do you mess up someone’s order 4 times in a roll? I need to get lottery or something. The food quality and taste is less than okay as well, I only order from them cuz they are close to where I live and delivery can be fast. Not that they are delicious or cheap at all. Just a waste of money to go there or order form them. The one time I’m at there store they forced me to order from a delivery platform while I AM PHYSICALLY IN THE STORE!
